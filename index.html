      8th September 2005 : Bel Air
    </h4>
    <P>
      As you've probably heard, this year's project for the 4th July was to make a car float.
      <A HREF="http://amrys.devl.org/blog/" target="amrys">Amrys</A>
      has an amazingly detailed
      <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/amrys/www/photo/bel-air/" target="amrys">log of the project</A>,
      but for those of you without a week to spare, I've assembled a

    <h4>
      4th March 2005 : At Long Last
    </h4>
    <P>
      I've finally got round to doing two things I've been promising to do for ages.
      <li> In an attempt to stem the flow of meaningless e-mither, I've set up a
           <A HREF="http://1knventures.proboards42.com" target=new>discussion board</A>
           for Venture types.
      <li> I've finally re-organized my

      12th August 2004 : Redesign
    </h4>
    <P>
      Apologies for the infrequency and rushed appearance of my recent updates, but I'm in the process of
      a major overhaul of this site.
      Check back soon to see the stunning results.
    </P>

    <h4>
      12th August 2004 : SolidLights
    </h4>
    <P>
      My friend <A TARGET="NEW" HREF="http://www.stumpie.com">Chris</A>
      has just released the latest model in his range of bike lights.
      The company website, at
      <A TARGET="NEW" HREF="http://www.solidlights.co.uk">www.solidlights.co.uk</A>,
      is fantastically nerdy and very well written.

      is just perfect.

      9th August 2004 : Brake Adapter
    </h4>
    <P>
      I've just finished making an adapter to fit my shiny new disc brake to the pre-standardisation
      mounts on my forks.
      You can read all about it
      <A HREF="brakeAdapter/index.html">here</A>,
      if you're into that kind of thing.

      Anyone who knows me will have heard me rave about the place already, but you should check Scott's

      I have grand plans for

      4th July 2004 : Obvious
    </h4>
    <P>
      Following tradition amongst a number of friends here, Greddy and I decided to build a raft
      so that we could watch the 4th July fireworks from the optimal viewing location in the middle of
      the Charles.
      Today saw the launch of the
      <A HREF="POTD/journal2004/index.html#cruftamaran">cruftamaran</A>,
      a plywood-hulled, polycarbonate-decked catamaran.
      We even got

      6rd June 2004 : Car Trouble
    </h4>
    <P>
      Thanks to some stunningly bad design on behalf of the engineers at Toyota, I managed to spend the
      entire weekend changing the transmission fluid in my car.
      Such stunningly bad design in fact, that I've written a detailed
      <A HREF="transmissionFluid/index.html">rant</A>
      on the subject.
    </P>

    <h4>
      3rd June 2004 : Crash
    </h4>
    <P>
      Today I was out riding with the
      <A HREF="thursday-bikers/index.html">thursday-bikers</A>
      at Lynn Woods and managed to do some pretty serious
      <A HREF="POTD/journal2004/index.html#bike">damage</A>
      to my trusty Avalanche frame.
      Pretty impressive considering that I was doing about 2mph at the time and that I walked away
      totally unscathed.
      I guess it's a good excuse for a new frame, and drivetrain, and cranks, and brakes, 
      and shifters, and mech ...
    </P>

    <h4>
      2nd June 2004 : New Job
    </h4>
    <P>
      Today I started work at
      <A TARGET="STATA" HREF="http://www.csail.mit.edu/index.html">CSAIL</A>
      (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) in
      <A TARGET="STATA" HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/williams/williams.shtml">Prof. Williams'</A>
      group.
      The group is based in the
      <A TARGET="STATA" HREF="http://web.mit.edu/buildings/statacenter/">Stata Center</A>. 
      Like it or not, you have to admit that the building is pretty

    <h4>
      1st June 2004 : GPS Troubles
    </h4>
    </P>
      Today I finally
      <A HREF="gps.html">figured out</A>
      why my GPS kept getting me lost in the White Mountains.
      Pretty useful if you want to avoid spending hours wandering around in waist deep snow and
      falling through ice into rivers, pretty boring otherwise.
    </P>

    <h4>
      30th May 2004 : Bike Rack
    </h4>
    <P>
      My latest construction project has been a bike rack for my car.
      In an effort to avoid paying $100 for the real thing, I came up with
      <A HREF="bikerack/index.html">this design</A>,
      which has proven to work pretty well.

      Today I received this from Rhys ...

      Not exactly news about me personally, but I couldn't let such an incredible event go unmarked.
      Congratulations to Rhys, Holly and baby Morgan.

      May 2004 : The Great Narrowboat Move
    </h4>
    <P>
      Catherine is currently moving her new home across the country
      and has been sending out progress reports via email.
      Now these are no ordinary emails, more like epic tales, and they've certainly kept me
      sane through many long hours in the lab.
      It seemed a waste to let these masterpieces drift off into cyberspace, so I've archived the collection
      <A HREF="narrowboat/index.html">here</A>.
    </P>
  
    <h4>
      7th May 2004 : Skis
    </h4>
    <P>
      Today I finished Version II of my
      <A HREF="skis/index.html">skis</A>,
      unfortunately just a couple of weeks too late for the last
      of the season's snow.
      Hopefully they'll prove a little more robust than the Version I design.
    </P>

    <h4>
      19th April 2004 : Bad Planning
    </h4>
    <P>
      Last night, at around 10:30pm, I decided to run the Boston marathon.
      The marathon was today.
    </P>
    <P>
      Surprisingly, I made it.
      Considering the 85 degree heat and 95% humidity, my time of four hours wasn't too bad either -
      the Boston Athletic Association were recommending that runners add an hour to their
      target time due to the absurd weather conditions.
    </P>
    <P>
      Having said that, this certainly ranks pretty high on my list of poorly though-out,
      last minute plans.
      So much so, I've compiled a list of marathon
      <A HREF="marathon.html"><I>do</I>s and <I>don't</I>s</A>.
     </P>

      30th March 2004 : Mountain Rescue Antics
    </h4>
    <P>
      Not to be outdone by John, Ben just added himself to my list of friends who've been
      airlifted from a crag.
      You can probably guess roughly what happened, but here are the details:
      Stanage Edge, <I>Four</I> (VS), no helmet, two cams pop, 9m onto his shoulders,
      quote on regaining consciousness, <I>"This is really happening isn't it?"</I>.
    </P>
    <P>
      Unbelievably, no broken bones, just lots of blood and plenty of stitches in his head.
      In his own words ...

    </h4>
    <P>
      Not really news, but today whilst avoiding doing any work, I came across
      <A TARGET=NEW HREF="http://www.world66.com/myworld66">this site</A>
      which lets you keep track of all the US states you've visited.

      John managed to fall 30ft at Tremadog the other weekend and mangle his face.
      He's OK now, so we can all make fun of him, which includes reading the BBC Wales
