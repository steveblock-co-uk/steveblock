<P><B>July 7, 2004</B><BR>The Coca-Cola "Unexpected Summer" GPS-can promotion is 
a <A 
href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=2328">threat to 
national security</A>. Ha. 
<P>I computed some statistics on my e-mail spam today. The seven-day average for 
spam received by my MIT address is 164.7 messages a day. That's a dramatic 
increase from my Nov 1-7 2003 average of 47.9 spam messages daily. 
<P>And yet people ridicule me for using <A href="http://www.tmda.net/">TMDA</A>. 

<P><B>July 6, 2004</B><BR>Another July 4 came and went. An excellent time was 
had by all (I assume) with dinner at the Pour House and fireworks-watching from 
the water. 
<P>I didn't build a boat this year, so five friends and I went out in a pair of 
inflatable rafts. Greddy and Steve built <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.co.uk/photos/julyFourth/IMG_2559.jpg">a cool craft</A> with a 
plexiglass deck. McBean was flying the Canadian flag from the crow's nest atop 
<A href="http://www.steveblock.co.uk/photos/julyFourth/IMG_2569.jpg">his triangular raft</A>. 

<P>Although the MITERS boats sailed uneventfully east of the fireworks barge, 
apparently the East Campus crowd didn't fare so well. At least one raft (a deck 
mounted on sketchy oil drums) was escorted from the water by State Police patrol 
boats. After reaching shore, those folks were presented with "release forms" to 
sign, which must have raised some stress levels! But as it turns out, the State 
Police were being shadowed by camera crews for one of those "Cops" shows, who 
needed the signatures of the guilty to put the whole act on television. Stay 
tuned. Another group from East Campus was forced underground by continued 
threats from MIT administrators (mostly the MIT Housing Office). Having thought 
they claimed victory by sneaking their craft off campus and down to the public 
dock near the Galleria, they were surprised when yet more State Police (rumored 
to have been acting on instructions from MIT) forced them to give up. I'm not 
clear on the eventual fate of their boat, but they weren't allowed in the water. 

<P>McBean spent the entire day on the Charles, which meant he was hassled at 
least 10 different times by various waterborne authorities. In one encounter 
with the MDC patrol boat, the cop mentioned that some group had tried to launch 
a "floating couch" from the Esplanade side of the river, but they were caught in 
time. 
<P>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I am deeply honored. 

<P><B>July 1, 2004</B><BR>I'm having a bad case of boat jealousy. For various 
reasons, I'm not really building one this year. Though I'm planning to help 
Quinn and Harvey with their barge-o'-astroturf. 
<P>At the labs, G-Funk and British Steve are building an interesting catamaran 
of plywood, sporting curves meticulously computed by Steve with his mad Matlab 
skills. I'm a little concerned about how they plan to seal the keel, but overall 
it's a pretty sweet endeavour. 
<P>McBean and his ladyfriend are almost done with their craft, an equilateral 
triangular platform supporting a 10' tall observation tower. It was sort of 
inspired by an oil rig. 
<P>Next year, I'm going nuts. 
<P><B>June 31, 2004</B><BR>Curiously, nothing happened on this day. 
<P><A name=spam><B>June 30, 2004</B><BR>Here is a casino giving away $25 Free 
when you sign up an account.<BR>No credit card required 
<P>Oh, just kidding. 
<P>I read an article in a trade magazine today about electronics manufacturing 
in China. The productivity of these people is amazing. The author briefly 
described two typical assembly workers. One inserts pins into USB connectors all 
day. She installs <I>eight thousand</I> pins a day. Another crimps tiny pins 
onto the ends of wires for use with another type of connector. She does 
<I>eleven thousand</I> of these in a shift.

While <A href="http://am.devl.org/blog/">everyone</A> is 
complaining about the MIT homepage, I thought I'd take a moment to remind you 
how terrible it all is without stylesheets. Think of what I have to go through, 
people. 
<P><A name=snoop-hemi><B>June 27, 2004</B><BR>Why don't I ever get good messages 
on my voicemail? Here's the transcript of one message left for the 
German-speaking CEO of Chrysler, Dieter Zetsche, as quoted in <A 
href="http://www.detnews.com/2004/autosinsider/0405/30/c01-167862.htm">The 
Detroit News</A>: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Yo, what up? This is big Snoop Dogg, trying to put these new legs 
  down for this new 300C. What I gotta' do to get that brand new 300 up outta' 
  you? Get back in contact with my nephew so you can make it happen, then it's 
  official like a referee's whistle. If you want this car to blow, give it to 
  me. This is Snoop Dogg. Preach!" </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "translation" they ran is even funnier. 
<P>Snoop Dogg's car consultant, "Big Slice," was <A 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/26/business/26bling.html">quoted in the New 
York Times</A> as saying "I wouldn't buy the Magnum without the Hemi. The car 
looks like it needs to go, so you might as well put the go in it." 
<P>The funny thing about this yearning for the Hemi -- a hemispherical 
combustion chamber design that was revolutionary in the 1960's -- is that it is 
a big piece of shit by today's standards. In fact, in order to meet modern 
emissions requirements with this design, Chrysler had to put <I>two</I> spark 
plugs in each cylinder. Without the second flame front, it suffers from 
incomplete combustion. 
<P>Chrysler's marketing genius has taken something boring and undesirable and 
turned it into a much sought-after commodity that people <I>dream</I> about. I 
should get them to help me with my foray into online dating. 
<P><A name=rooney><B>June 26, 2004</B><BR>I spent some time today catching up on 
transcripts of Andy Rooney's "60 Minutes" commentaries. People who write him off 
as a curmudgeon may not appreciate his sense of humor. But where Rooney really 
shines, I think, is when he's being perfectly serious. I will never have his 
extraordinary powers of observation, keenness of wit, and remarkably rich life 
experiences, but I certainly hope that when I'm 84, I will be as sharp as he is. 

<P>His <A 
href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/25/60minutes/rooney/main619533.shtml">explanation 
of Memorial Day</A> is both enlightening and very moving. The same goes for his 
<A 
href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/03/60minutes/rooney/main620916.shtml">remarks 
on the 60th anniversary of D-Day</A>. The last paragraphs of his comments on the 
torture of Iraqi prisoners, "<A 
href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/20/60minutes/rooney/main618783.shtml">Our 
Darkest Days Are Here</A>, are so powerful that they elude summary. 
<P>Regular readers of this space are probably tired of the seemingly endless 
praise I heap upon Mr. Rooney. But while the prolification of "experts" and 
"pundits" has made television news almost completely irrelevant -- especially <A 
href="http://cnnsucks.devl.org/">cable news</A> -- we all have something to gain 
from that the medium still carries the voice of someone old enough to know 
history, and its relevance to our modern lives, firsthand. 
<P>Sharing this kind of knowledge in a personally relevant way is magic. 
<P>Last month, I flew to Minneapolis for the funeral of my grandfather. Prior to 
his career as a machinist, woodworker, and inventor, he served in the Navy 
during World War II. Nobody knew much more than that, and he wasn't interested 
in talking about it, either. (He had a "difficult" personality, although the two 
of us had nothing short of mutual admiration for each other.) 
<P>So it was an eye-opening experience to sit in his basement the day before the 
funeral, leafing through the WWII photo album he would never let anyone look at. 
His discharge papers listed him as a "projectionist," but somehow or another he 
wound up delivering play-by-play baseball coverage for the Armed Forces Radio 
Service. His voice broadcast across Europe. There were photos of him sitting on 
a stoop in Italy, smoking a pipe, mimicing an old wartime portrait of his 
father. Dinner menus from mess halls all over the world. The stories that could 
have been told! 
<P>His War Department is my Defense Department. His Armed Forces Radio Service 
is now my <I>American</I> Forces Radio and Television Service. His experiences 
were his own, but whatever I had to learn from them is lost to time. 
<P>Which should help explain, in part, my fascination with Andy Rooney. 
<P><A name=votomatic-article><B>June 24, 2004</B><BR>I knew my Salon.com 
subscription was good for something. "<A 
href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2004/06/23/votesure/index.html">The Last 
Lone Inventor</A>" is the best piece of journalism I've read in a long time. 
<P>It's the story of an 86-year-old mechanical engineer who still works 10-hour 
days. He still dates women half his age. He designed the ubiquitous Votomatic 
punch-card voting machine in 1963. And, when companies like Diebold are pushing 
$4500 computerized voting terminals in the wake of the Florida election debacle 
-- despite <A 
href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/dieboldftp.html">disturbingly 
questionable performance</A> -- he intends to "save democracy" with a simple 
$200 mechanical voting machine. Affordable enough for <I>every</I> precinct. 
Reliable, trustworthy, and transparent in operation. Simple and easy to use. 
Brilliant. 
<P>Did I mention this same inventor styles himself after <A 
href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/farnsworth.html">Philo Farnsworth</A>? 
<P>I need to meet this guy. 
<P><A name=bullshit><B>June 23, 2004</B><BR>Check out this snazzy new 
stylesheet. I call it "shades of gray." Thanks to everyone for their help. 
<P><A name=parade><B>June 21, 2004</B><BR>Yesterday, on my way to work (yeah, on 
a Sunday), I was stopped by a police roadblock on Beacon Street. My curiosity 
was satisfied by the near-simultaneous arrival of a marching band, what turned 
out to be the start of Brookline's <A 
href="http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/FlagDay/Index.html">Flag Day parade</A>. 
Having worked for the organizers of several parades in my distant past, I know 
better than to run across a parade route, as a couple of impatient folks did. So 
I waited on the street corner and watched. The veterans. The gymnasts. The Elks 
Lodge Local somethingoranother. The local cycling group, which stopped at my 
corner and begged me to join them for the rest of the parade (a duty which I 
talked my way out of). Eventually, some dude in combat fatigues driving a 
flag-bedecked <A href="http://www.army.mil/fact_files_site/hmmwv/">HMMWV</A> 
stopped and waved a bunch of us across the street. So I continued on, even 
though the bagpipers were just around the corner. 
<P>As luck(?) would have it, I got my dose of bagpipes later in the night, since 
Feldmeier was listening to "<A href="http://www.irishbagpipes.com/">Tones and 
Drones</A>" on WZBC. 
<P><A name=bad-bush><B>June 19, 2004</B><BR>The other day in Kenmore Square, no 
less than four volunteers wearing Democratic National Committee jackets asked me 
"Wanna help get Bush out of office?" (Why they ask this and not, "want to help 
elect John Kerry," is a good question, but not the one I want to address here.) 
<P>What these volunteers actually wanted was not my vote, but my money. I don't 
have any problem giving money to a cause I believe in, but the fraction of each 
dollar that goes to pay for John Kerry's <A 
href="http://www.iht.com/articles/517579.html">peanut butter sandwiches</A> is 
pretty meager, no doubt, compared to what bankrolls the television commercials. 
I don't watch television, nor do I revel in its frightening influence. 
<P>I mention influence because today I read a Salon.com article, "<A 
href="http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2004/06/18/ad_damage/index.html">Kerry 
Still Standing Despite Ads' Damage</A>." The article cites a study that proves 
the effectiveness of $80 million in TV advertising by the Bush campaign in the 
last 3 months. This advertising is apparently as much anti-Kerry as it is 
pro-Bush. They mention one example of Senator Kerry being "indecisive" on some 
issue or another, which is an even dirtier trick than that which I complained 
about last time because it relies completely on the public's ignorance of the 
nitty-gritty of parliamentary procedure. Like the simple fact that bills go 
through multiple revisions, which wouldn't work at all if people didn't change 
their votes. You simply can't pass this off as waffling on the greater issues. 
That any of the public was swayed by this argument makes me wonder if the 
popular vote is simply a waste of time. 
<P>Meanwhile, I'll be keeping an eye on the Goodwill store in case any of those 
D.N.C. volunteer jackets show up. I'm determined to stay ahead of this fashion 
trend. 
<P><A name=cellphones><B>June 18, 2004</B><BR>The New York Times made my day 
with their story on the U.S. Open, "<A 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/19/sports/golf/19CELL.html">Such Sorrow to 
Part With Cellphones</A>." 
<P>Choice quotes follow. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"If I have a heart attack, who's going to call 911?" said Claudia 
  Mutter, 50, from Coventry, R.I., who said she was unaware of the cellphone 
  ban, even though it was printed on the back of tournament tickets. "Seriously, 
  I have to call home and check on my kids. Now I can't relax." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Going to an outdoor sporting event must be awfully stressful. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Doug and Ginny Johnstone, 40, from Wantagh, N.Y., said the ban 
  made it hard to check on their year-old son, Daniel, who is sick. "It's hard 
  not having that lifeline," said Ginny Johnstone, who struggled with the pay 
  phone. "It keeps asking me for more quarters and then cutting me off." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When I was sick as a one-year-old, my parents stayed home to take care of me. 
But times are different, I suppose. Last but not least: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I have a promotions and marketing company," [Brandon] Yankowitz 
  said, "and my cellphone is my life." </BLOCKQUOTE>
