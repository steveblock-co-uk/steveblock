    <h4>
      Sorry, the LandRover is now sold !
    </h4>
    <P>
      It's been bought by my good friend Bart, who must be crazy,
      becasue he's been a passenger in it and still wasn't put off!
      I'm sure that pictures of the LandRover in silly situations
      around the country will soon be appearing on his
      <A TARGET="new" HREF="http://www.barts-web.com">website</A>.

      I'm moving to Boston in September, so it looks like I'm
      going to have to sell my LandRover. It's been great fun
      to own and to drive and I'll be sad to see it go.
      It was built in December 1972 and registered in January 1973,
      making it the youngest 'historic vehicle' money can buy!

      It's been my everyday vehicle for the last four years and has
      been totally reliable, the most serious problem being a broken
      fanbelt!

      As you can see from the pictures, it's in great condition and
      the chassis is very good with only a little rust on the
      bulkhead.

      I bought it four years ago at which point I carried out a major
      service. Since then it's been well maintained and has had
      considerable work done on it, although nothing major.

      Most notably I've replaced worn stub axles, brake slave
      cylinders and door locks, upgraded all brake pipes to copper
      and plugged many oil leaks!

    <P>
      If you're interested in buying it, I'm located in Cambridge and
      you can most easily contact me by
      <A HREF="mailto:landrover@steveblock.co.uk">email</A>.
