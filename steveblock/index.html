<H3>Interesting Development</H3>
<P>In a long discussion that eventually turned to Michael Moore (he sucks, 
confirm/deny) and politics I and others as well witnessed a strange thing. Kyle 
Poorman—local pacifist and all around good guy—exploded into a huge rant, 
something far out of character for him. At the same time I was not even remotely 
angry; fairly out of character for me as well. </P>
<H4>03:25</H4>
<H2>28 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Chill</H3>
<P>Do you ever get a strange chill that starts somewhere and then rushes all 
through your body? It's an interesting sensation. I assume that the feeling is 
caused by some kind of physiological action, but I don't know what. After all, a 
thought can cause some part of your body to shiver, or feel strange or cold. 
How? Then, the feeling rushes through the rest of you, from your head all the 
way down to your toes.</P>
<P>Of course its just an assumption that everyone experiences something similar 
from time to time, but it seems a valid one.</P>
<P>I saw most of my dad's side of the family at our annual Christmas gathering 
in Remsen yesterday. There are so many kids now. There have to be at least 
thirty grandchildren, though I don't have an exact count. The oldest is around 
27 or 28, and the youngest only a few weeks old. Still no great-grandchildren 
though. </P>
<H4>23:27</H4>
<H2>25 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Merry Christmas</H3>
<P>I hope everyone had a good Christmas</P>
<P>I saw Dr. Pate in church this morning. Our conversation went something like 
this:</P>
<P>Me: Merry Christmas, Dr. Pate.<BR>Dr. Pate: Oh, hey Steve. Guess we can have 
a meeting now.<BR>Me: NO! </P>
<H4>21:06</H4>
<H2>22 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Hi to the Family</H3>
<P>The Baumhover Christmas gathering was last night, and I was once again 
reminded that much of my family keeps tabs on this web site. I'll take this time 
to say hi to all of them, especially Doug, since he asked me to put his name up 
here.</P>
<P>Thanks also to Jolene. I now have a pair of needle nose pliers, and Bruce 
Springsteen is in the CD player right now. </P>
<H4>13:33</H4>
<H2>20 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Lots of Work Left</H3>
<P>This page still needs a lot of work before it'll work properly.</P>
<P>So much inconsistency. </P>
<H4>23:33</H4>
<H3>New Design (again)</H3>
<P>I threw together a new design over the past few days. The archives are 
somewhat broken in IE for Windows, due to content that is too wide for the 
window. I'll figure something out though. The photographs section hasn't been 
reformatted yet either.</P>
<P>Either way I need to get going, I should be headed to Sam Miller's graduation 
party already. </P>
<H4>18:33</H4>
<H2>19 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Shopping</H3>
<P>Christmas shopping is finished. I may have set a personal record, since I'm 
usually in the store on Christmas Eve trying to finish up. Not this year, 
though. </P>
<H4>16:53</H4>
<H2>16 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>So Close</H3>
<P>After a long twelve hours on campus, I am mere hours from finishing my last 
final exam. I have very nearly completed Problem 1, thoroughly beaten Problems 2 
and 3, and am so close to finishing Problem 4 that I can almost taste 
victory.</P>
<P>But really, this test is nowhere near the cluster-fuck that the last fluids 
exam was. I have already completed more of this test with 16 hours to spare than 
I did the first when I handed it in. </P>
<H4>22:58</H4>
<H2>15 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>One Down, One to Go</H3>
<P>I am finished with my thermodynamics final; now on to fluid mechanics! </P>
<H4>00:41</H4>
<H2>13 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Back In Business</H3>
<P>My dad helped me put a new battery in the Taurus, and now it cranks faster 
than it has in a long time. I am back in business and back on the streets. Watch 
out. </P>
<H4>14:34</H4>
<H2>12 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Solaris 9</H3>
<P>So I decided to sell my soul, and downloaded the free version of Sun's 
Solaris 9 for x86. It only took forever to get it installed, and there are still 
issues with the old S3 ViRGE graphics chip in the machine. In one configuration 
I get a monstrous square as the cursor and images display as noise. In another 
configuration (VESA) the top inch or so of the screen is broken. It is also 
slow, though whether to blame Solaris or a 200 MHz machine with 64 megs of RAM 
is a tough call.</P>
<P>Perhaps I'll unload it and install it over the Windows drive on the Dell 
instead. At least the hardware in that Dell seems to work perfectly. </P>
<H4>00:15</H4>
<H2>09 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Test Stage</H3>
<P>The ideas outlined in <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/design/">Design</A> 
are in place on the server at home. <A href="http://d2.steveblock.com/">Test 
it</A> if you can handle the ultra-slowness of my cable modem's upstream pipe. 
</P>
<H4>18:20</H4>
<H2>08 Dec 2003</H2>
<H3>Design Update</H3>
<P>The contact page url has changed to /contact/, and I am using a very 
rudimentary mod_rewrite rule to shorten the urls for the archive pages 
(eliminating the nasty /index.cgi/xxxx/ with just /xxxx/. Since I am using 
mod_rewrite this solution is not portable, and it will fail if I ever switch web 
servers. I consider this a cheap and dirty hack, and will continue to 
investigate other possible ways to achieve the same effect. No progress has been 
made yet with the photo galleries, but I have some ideas. </P>
<H4>23:12</H4>
<H3>Design</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.steveblock.com/design/">An essay</A> on a major website 
redesign on which I will soon be working. </P>
<H4>17:53</H4>
<H3><A href="http://www.ashpool.com/strategy/2003/12/webhid/">HID For The 
Web</A></H3>
<P>Noting a good point brought up by <A 
href="http://www.ashpool.com/strategy/2003/12/webhid/">this document</A>, I have 
adjusted my background color to make this site easier on the eyes. Enjoy. </P>

<H3>This Will Sound Stupid in the Morning</H3>
<P>Sometimes, when I am all alone, I like to imagine myself five years from now. 
Mostly I think of the person I am with. How does she see me? What are our 
conversations like? Are we equals, or does one person dominate the other? I run 
through conversations in my head. I close my eyes and imagine holding her close, 
feeling her shape and her warmth. I imagine that she breathes a certain vitality 
into my being that is missing now, a vitality that brings me out of the slump I 
am in and dissolves the anger I so often feel. It is wonderful to think these 
things. There is something missing from these thoughts, however. I never know 
how i get to that place from where I am now. Maybe that's where and why i am 
stuck. </P>

<H3>Ames Demographics</H3>
<P>Ames is a very white city. I've always known this but never though about it 
much. Check out the stats though, it's crazy. The numbers don't quite work out 
perfectly, which is likely because there are many people classified under two or 
more races.</P>

his link is back in full force. Go Samm! I didn't make poker night because I was

<H3>Quality Control</H3>
<P>A slight change of phrasing can make all the difference:</P>
<P>From the King's X demo <EM>Quality Control</EM>:<BR><EM>If there's a light 
inside <STRONG>let it shine!</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>From the King's X song <EM>Happy</EM>, which is directly descended from 
<EM>Quality Control</EM>:<BR><EM>If there's a light inside <STRONG>it'll 
shine!</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>The latter phrase carries with it far more hope than the former, which is 
sung as if there really isn't any light inside after all. </P>
<H4>23:12</H4>
<H3>More Photos</H3>
<P>I posted two new photo galleries today. <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0037">The first</A> is from my 
walk through East River Valley Park last week, and <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0038">the second</A> is from 
Andy and my trip around Ames and the Iowa State Center. Enjoy. </P>
<H4>22:32</H4>
<H2>29 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Back</H3>
<P>It was nice to see my grandparents again. It has been quite a while. They are 
buying a house in town, which is going to be different. They have lived in their 
farmhouse for my entire life. I have explored almost every nook and cranny in 
the house and surrounding buildings. I don't know what will happen to the farm, 
but it's definitely going to be an interesting change. </P>
<H4>20:37</H4>
<H2>26 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Links</H3>
<P>Some links to the left are disappearing. I'll need a good reason to put them 
back. </P>
<H4>15:35</H4>
<H2>23 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Disclosure</H3>
<P>I am trying to get it working the way I want, but the path of least 
resistance is to just stick with what I have.</P>
<P class=post>Of course I'm still trying to get it to work the way I like, and I 
probably won't be giving up for a little while yet.</P>
<P class=post>P.S. Stevedist is working fine and can use the usb keyboard and 
mouse, so you can stop making fun of it. </P>
<H4>22:18</H4>
<H2>21 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Campus Photos</H3>
<P>The <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0036">photographs</A> 
I took on Tuesday with the newly purchased zoom lens are up now. I think they 
turned out well. </P>
<H4>20:09</H4>
<H3>Ames Photos</H3>
<P>Andy and I met today and took some photos around town. We started by main 
street, which has a lot of cool buildings that are somehow not very photogenic. 
After getting bored of that, and getting some refreshments at Stomping Grounds, 
we went to Scheman where we encountered hundreds of high school musicians and 
many displays from music schools and instrument makers. All State is here. We 
explored Stephens Auditorium, which is perhaps the coolest building in Ames, 
from top to bottom as well, which was a real treat. I highly recommend checking 
out the <A 
href="http://www.symposed.com/pictures/index.php?/light/img075">pictures</A> 
that Andy has already posted. </P>
<H4>19:48</H4>
<H2>20 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Pendulum</H3>
<P>I bought this <A 
href="http://www.artsuppliesonline.com/catalog.cfm?cata_id=7987">Papermate 
Pendulum</A> pen last night and I've been writing with it for a while this 
morning. It's strange and weird looking and i don't know if it's really any 
better or less stressful to write with or anything like that, but it does write 
smoothly. Also, no matter what way you turn the pen the point always faces down. 
Surprisingly the head doesn't feel loose or wobbly when writing. Hooray for 
gravity.</P>
<P class=post>It's probably not much good for writing in space, though. </P>
<H4>11:47</H4>
<H3>Continuity 4, Obscura 2, and Stevedist Test One</H3>
<P>First, before you make fun of me for naming my test distribution after 
myself, you should know that I didn't name it. Alex did.</P>
<P class=post>Now that Continuity 4 is up on <A 
href="http://www.ashpool.com/">Ashpool</A> along with Obscura 2, I decided to 
take my fresh-minted Linux OS for a web serving test run. Continuity, Obscura, 
and Stevedist all seem to be getting along rather nicely, as you can see from my 
Obscura <A href="http://gaskill.steveblock.com/">test page</A>. Bear with the 
speed of that server, it's on a cable connection.</P>
<P class=post>Who needs Apache? </P>
<H4>01:18</H4>
<H2>18 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Lens</H3>
<P>It is here. I think I might disappear for the rest of the afternoon to use 
zoom.</P>
<P class=post>Now if I get a wide angle zoom I will be set. </P>
<H4>14:53</H4>
<H2>17 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Koyaanisqatsi</H3>
<P>Strange film. Certainly interesting in its filming style and score, though 
i'm not sure that it was really best for it to be a full length film. A lot of 
the camerawork and location choice was quite neat, but at the same time it could 
be said that it's nothing more than a Philip Glass album with pictures.</P>
<P class=post>Not to be avoided, but I'm not sure I could recommend it. </P>
<H4>22:30</H4>
<H2>16 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Food</H3>
<P>Today around 1:00 PM I made apartment history by cooking the first actual 
whole meal that has been cooked in our apartment since Sam and I moved in in 
August. Chicken breast and corn and a baked potato along with a glass of milk. 
The only thing missing was somewhere to eat it! </P>
<H4>20:25</H4>
<H3>Something I Should Have Done A Long Time Ago</H3>
<P>I never actually finished scanning the photographs I took in Kansas City last 
July. I have now made up for this, and the <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0023">the KC gallery</A> 
contains twenty-two previously unreleased photographs. </P>
<H4>02:28</H4>
<H2>15 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Photography</H3>
<P>I have an amazing desire to take photographs. I'm looking forward to getting 
the zoom lens and taking it for a spin. I think that scanning all those 
photographs the other day, along with buying the lens and changing over to <A 
href="http://www.ashpool.com/obscura/">Obscura</A> has helped to rekindle my 
photography fire.</P>
<P class=post>Anyone else who wants to take pictures let me know and we'll go 
exploring somewhere. </P>
<H4>20:52</H4>
<H2>14 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>UPS Does Good Work</H3>
<P>Only a fine company like UPS could ship from Houston to Houston so 
quickly.</P>
<P class=post><IMG alt=ups src="ups.png"> 
</P>
<H4>02:43</H4>
<H3>Huge Photo Update</H3>
<P>I added seven photo galleries tonight. Thank goodness <A 
href="http://www.ashpool.com/obscura/">Obscura</A> makes it easy to add photos, 
because scanning was a major pain in the ass, and Gallery is also a major 
pain.</P>
<P class=post>Seriously though, there's some good stuff there, so <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php">check them out</A> if you have the time. 
</P>
<H4>00:52</H4>
<H2>13 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3></H3>
<P>Screw it, I am finished with Gallery. </P>
<H4>14:28</H4>
<H3>Obscura is Live</H3>
<P>The navbar on the left has been updated to reflect that my galleries have 
been imported into <A href="http://www.ashpool.com/obscura/">Obscura</A>. The 
link to <A href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">Gallery</A> will probably 
disappear sometime soon. </P>
<H4>14:24</H4>
<H3>Test Photo Gallery</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.tessier.com/">Alex</A> has rewritten Obscura, his gallery 
code, and version 2 is much easier to understand and use. I am working on 
embedding his code into my site to create an image gallery that fits right in 
with the rest of the layout. Go ahead and <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/02a.php?">test it</A>. It should pretty much act 
like just another part of the site. </P>
<H4>02:14</H4>
<H2>12 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Keyboard</H3>
<P>Stevedist doesn't like my USB keyboard. Time to look around the net for some 
kind of HOWTO I suppose. What fun. Maybe all I need to do is add the modules, 
but I'm not sure. Couldn't expect the first boot of the system to go perfectly I 
suppose. </P>
<H4>21:06</H4>
<H2>11 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Haircut</H3>
<P>I was toying with the idea of growing my hair long again, but it was spending 
way too much time in my eyes when I was trying to do other things. Now it's 
short again and my head looks smaller.</P>
<P class=post>Stevedist is progressing, though slowly. </P>
<H4>23:33</H4>
<H2>10 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Linux</H3>
<P>And so the grand build-my-own-distribution adventure begins today. I look 
forward to many hours of compiling, followed by more compiling. I'm still 
working on the toolchain I'll need to compile without having dependencies on the 
host <A href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</A> installation. Once that's 
finished I'll be able to compile a lot of stuff all over again. Joy. At least my 
main machine runs OSX, so I'll be able to get some actual work done. </P>
<H4>23:46</H4>
<H2>09 Nov 2003</H2>
<H3>Analog</H3>
<P>Thanks to <A href="http://www.symposed.com/">Andy's</A> hard work I can now 
check my statistics with <A href="http://www.analog.cx/">Analog.</A> There seem 
to be a surprising number of hits from Canada, considering that I don't know 
anyone there. <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/analog">See</A> for yourself.

<H3>Arrr</H3>
<P>Ben and I decided to see Pirates of the Caribbean tonight since it finally 
made it to the dollar theater. We got up right to the front of the huge line and 
we were next when they put up the Sold Out sign over pirates. Arrr! We got 
screwed.</P>
<P class=post>Suddenly without anything to do, we picked up a 12 pack of 
Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat and some tortilla chips, and watched the directors 
cut of Das Boot, which neither of us had ever seen. Other than the fact that it 
was hella long, it was awesome.</P>

<H3>The Matrix</H3>
<P>Revolutions, though fun at times, didn't even come close to living up to the

<H3>Lens</H3>
<P>Purchased a Canon 70-210mm F/4 zoom lens off of ebay today. It will be a few 
few days before the PayPal payment clears though, and the guy won't ship until 
it does. I'm not too worried about being hosed though, since the guy's feedback 
is crazy high. I just don't want to wait. After this if I get a wider zoom 
(28-70 or something) I'll have pretty much the whole range I would normally want 
to shoot at covered by just two lenses. No matter though, it is definitely time 
to move on from just having a 50mm lens, as useful as it is. </P>

<H3>Exceed</H3>
<P>The computers in Black (at least in 95E) have a piece of Hummingbird software 
called Exceed on them now. It's an X server, which means that I can run any 
pretty much any unix program remotely from these Windows machines.</P>
<P class=post>I used to keep a really old Windows X server in my user directory 
just to run a few programs from home or from one of the CLUE machines. It was a 
total piece of crap but it had the advantage of not needing to be installed 
locally.</P>
<P class=post>It's too bad that I don't really have a practical use for it now, 
because I would have just about killed for this a couple of years ago. </P>

<H3>Too Much Complaining</H3>
<P>I spent quite a bit of time inserting all my old blog posts from two previous 
incarnations of this page. This was a manual process, so I pretty much read 
every single post. There is definite evidence of a negative bias. I think I need 
to double check my outlook on life. After all, I can't be negative all the 
time.</P>
<P class=post>Anyways, the old posts are all up and available through the 
archive links. I'm going to check my drives later; I've been blogging for a long

did, but there are some guys in that class who are pretty crazy when it comes to 
differential equations.</P>
<P class=post>Dr. Olsen gave us a choice today: he could go over the the test we 
had just handed in, or he could teach new material. Everyone seemed strongly in 
favor of new material. It can't have been much fun for anyone if no one wanted 
to know how well they did. </P>

feel that I just can't think anymore. At least not in the way that is required 
to solve certain types of problems.</P>

<H3>Don't Use Thermodynamics To Prove A Point When You Don't Know What You Are

<P>Normally I wouldn't care so much, but 1) I have a degree in mechanical 
engineering with emphasis in the thermal sciences, and 2) I have a major 
thermodynamics test at 2:00 today. Because of that <A 
href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-thermodynamics.html">this 
pathetic attempt to use the second law of thermodynamics to disprove 
evolutionary theory</A> really upsets me. The second law deals with 
<STRONG><EM>energy</EM></STRONG>, not matter, not wear, or erosion, or 
evolution. They even go so far as to quote Kelvin (of the Kelvin-Planck 
statement, one of the definitions of the second law), and then interpret that 
statement as something entirely and completely different. This is 
misinformation, and it is damaging.</P>
<P class=post>Another incredibly annoying thing they perpetuate is the myth that 
entropy is disorder. If entropy were simply disorder than it would be difficult 
for me to quantify it, but quantify it I most certainly can. Let me say this 
succinctly: <EM><A 
href="http://www.entropysite.com/entropy_isnot_disorder.html">Entropy is not 
disorder!</A></EM> You might also want to check out <A

details and articles are available on the <A

of your Creationist friends tries to prove that evolution is impossible because 
of the second law, you can kindly inform him that he is, in fact, smoking crack.

were, as always, excellent, and the opening band Fishbone was something to see. 
The singer/saxophonist had an excellent voice, and could easily give lessons in

<H3>Books</H3>
<P>I've been reading a lot lately. I started a few weeks ago with 
<EM>Anthem</EM> by Ayn Rand and Neal Stephenson's <EM>Snow Crash</EM>, then I 
read <EM>The Diamond Age</EM>, also by Stephenson. Yesterday I went to the 
library and checked out the first volume of Tad Williams' <EM>Otherland</EM>, 
<EM>Virtual Light</EM> from William Gibson, and a book I read when I was a kid: 
Robert Heinlein's <EM>Have Space Suit - Will Travel</EM>. This last one was 
something that I only remembered a few details from, but they were enough to 
find the book using Amazon's new full text search. I was surprised to find that 
it was a Heinlein novel; I hadn't expected it to be by anyone I recognized. He 
must have some power in his writing that really makes it stand out. </P>

<H3>They Did It Again</H3>
<P><A 
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/10/23/0217256.shtml?tid=123&amp;tid=98&amp;tid=99">Slashdot 
strikes again</A>. </P>
<H4>09:45</H4>
<H2>22 Oct 2003</H2>
<H3>/.</H3>
<P>I wonder if anyone can explain the mystery of <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</A>. It's one of the most popular "news" 
sites in the internet, and seems to be able to kill most small sites at will, 
yet it's suffers from three major problems that should (but for some reason 
don't) kill its credibility.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Obvious bias 
  <LI>Little (if any) fact checking 
  <LI>Old news is posted as new </LI></OL>
<P class=post><STRONG>Obvious bias:</STRONG> There is no question that the posts 
and comments on slashdot are strongly in favor of anything Linux, open source, 
etc, and strongly opposed to anything corporate, especially Microsoft. While 
this is not a problem for an individual's web site, or even a small 
collaborative one, a site with as much exposure as slashdot would do well to 
temper this bias. There is a strong odor of zealotry coming from both the posts 
and comments, and in the end zealotry really only hurts the cause of the 
zealot.</P>
<P class=post><STRONG>Little (if any) fact checking:</STRONG> Posts tend to go 
up on slashdot quickly, and without any apparent fact checking. Although most of 
the time this does not cause problems, the posts are outright wrong too often 
for comfort. For example, there was a <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/10/22/173243.shtml?tid=155&amp;tid=98&amp;tid=99">post 
today</A> about X10 having to pay $4.3 million in damages for their pop-under 
ads. While that is correct, the ever present expository included in the post 
concludes that this was because the pop-under ads were a proprietary technology. 
If you <A href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/031020/ap/d7ua18q81.html">look more 
closely</A> though the real issue is that X10 was a client of the people awarded 
damages, and they weren't paying their bill. This sort of fact checking doesn't 
seem to matter to the slashdot crowd though, and many of the subsequent comments 
are all about how bad software patents are, etc. Now this is just one example, 
but its indicative of a more general trend.</P>
<P class=post><STRONG>Old news posted as new:</STRONG> This one is more subtle 
and perhaps less worthy of criticism, but since things posted on slashdot tend 
to spread through the web like wildfire it's worth noting. I frequently (more 
than usual lately) find that posts on slashdot are often about the same topic I 
read about days or even weeks earlier. I'm not claiming that I have some great 
line on information, I just check quite a few different news sites regularly. 
Even so, as soon as something makes its way to slashdot it spreads like crazy, 
and everyone seems to think it's new information. The most recent major example 
of this is the recent release of Maya Personal Learning Edition. Andy and Ben 
discovered this bit of good news way back in the winter one night when we were 
sitting in his parents' basement watching TV. I remember complaining because I 
used Linux and there was no Linux version (no longer an issue with the 
Powerbook). When version 5 was released slashdot posted the news like it was 
something entirely novel and new, and it quickly spread all over the internet 
like it was a grand and wonderful thing never heard of before. Slashdot should 
know better. This of course sort of ties in with issue 2, but it's less outright 
wrong than it is misleading.</P>
<P class=post>Somehow, though, even with all these problems slashdot is still 
incredibly popular. And the real rub is that I read it every day for reasons I 
don't even understand. </P>

<H3>This Is My Exit</H3>
<P>Tonight I was reading a book, and decided that it might be time to get ready 
for bed. When I finished the chapter I was reading, I glanced at the page number 
and mumbled "this is my exit" to myself. Realizing what I said, I pondered for a 
moment and decided that it was something profound, if only in reflecting the way 
America distributes itself from one location to another. The page number in 
question was page 111, and the significance is that whenever I am heading back 
to Ames on Interstate 35 (the vast majority of all my trips) I invariably take 
Exit 111 from the interstate to Highway 30, which leads straight into town. 
Hence, "this is my exit."</P>
<P class=post>111 is like a beacon to me when I drive. I count down the miles to 
that last exit by watching the mile markers. I check my speed and do some quick 
math to figure out how long it will take me to get home. For all practical 
purposes 111 is home. It's my exit. </P>

<H3>Good Weekend</H3>
<P>This weekend went rather well, considering everything. On Friday we got 
together at Sam Miller's place and played poker. Amazingly enough, I wasn't the 
firt one out, but I did lose. Saturday was Ryan and Julie's wedding, and the 
wedding reception, which lasted late into the night. Today I mostly worked on 
homework and tried to get Liz to do her physics. It was a fairly busy weekend, 
but overall it was also a good one. </P>

<H3>Writing on the Wall</H3>
<P>I'm in the library, in one of the little study cubicle things, and I want to 
make an observation. I go to a university. It's a large land grant university, 
but generally it's a fairly high quality institution. Now with this in mind I 
really have to wonder. The front wall of the cubicle is covered with 
obscenities, poor grammar, and a host of other things that make it look like 
unruly teenagers got out a whole box of pencils and started writing everything 
they could think of on on the walls. What's even more amazing is that some of it 
looks pretty old, and it's all in pencil. It seems that no one has made an 
attempt to clean it up.</P>
<P class=post>Imagine that we blow ourselves up with nukes and civilization has 
to start anew. What if 1000 years from now some future anthropologist finds 
those walls. It's an interesting idea.</P>
<P class=post>Makes you wonder if the majority of Egyptian hieroglyphics were

<H3>Kill Bill Volume One</H3>
<P>Very Tarantino. Very over-the-top. Very bloody. Very well done. One of the 
best movies I have seen in a long time. The fight scenes (most of the movie) 
were excellent. I am especially appreciative of the way he used music to set the 
tone. Most of the time in movies the soundtrack is just a backdrop for action 
and not much else. Tarantino's choices in this film seem more purposeful. He 
uses dead silence in a way that is almost reverent, and even when what you see 
is funny you try hard to not laugh; to not break the moment he has so carefully 
crafted. He also uses music that sounds like Latin dance during a Japanese sword 
battle. It should be out of place, but somehow it's not. Another thing he uses 
well is black and white photography. It turns a bloody battle into something 
almost like dance; a ballet if you will, and it doesn't seem like a "I'm going 
to switch to black and white to be cool" thing but a "this would look better in 
black and white" thing. There is also an excellent sequence shot in black 
silhouettes on a blue background. I noticed some really long takes as well. I am 
quite impressed.</P>
<P class=post>This is the part where I say "Lucy Liu is hot!" I'd like to say 
that, but it doesn't seem right anymore, to just run around saying people are 
hot like "hot" is where it's at. I think I'm going to break the mold and say 
that she is quite simply beautiful, and if you don't agree that's OK, because I 
doubt that your brain is wired like mine. </P>

<H3>Unexpected Beauty on the Engineering Side of Campus</H3>
<P>As I was leaving Black at around 10:30 this evening I noticed how nice the 
new fountains in front of Howe Hall look in the night, with lights lighting up 
each jet from below. A quick walk across the street showed that Howe's sister 
hall, Hoover has a long low stone wall facing the building that looks like it 
might be a water wall. The top of the wall has water and it looks like it's just 
waiting to be turned on. What I also noticed was that the overall effect of 
Howe, Hoover, and the infamous skywalk is actually to create a rather attractive 
complex.</P>
<P class=post>I'm glad to find this unexpected beauty, especially since I always 
thought that Howe was kind of ugly. In fact, in the dark the the look of the 
whole complex is rather enhanced by the skywalk. I'm kind of conflicted now, 
since it is really unnecessary and a waste of money, but at the same time it's 
impressive.</P>
<P class=post>I'm going to have to take my camera and tripod out there soon. 
Hopefully the water wall will be turned on so that I can get some shots of that, 
as well as the fountains, the way the light plays across the building windows, 
and the buildings themselves. The best part might be that these buildings are 
new enough that photos of them aren't overdone yet. I might just be able to 
catch something new. </P>

<H3>Back in Town</H3>
<P>I just got back to Ames a few minutes ago. My friend Kyle came down from 
Minneapolis on Friday afternoon. We shot some pool and went to see the 
Specialists play at Hickory Hall, then out to Lovish where Poorman once again 
won't take no for an answer. I got over my hangover fairly quickly though, and 
Kyle and I left Ames around 10:00 AM to head to Bedford for Alicia's wedding. 
The wedding itself was really nice, though it's still kind of weird to think 
that Alicia is actually married now.</P>
<P class=post>The best part of the night (other than the wedding itself) was 
that I got to talk to my old boss, Stephanie (she is Alicia's older sister) and 
catch up everything that's been happening. It was definitely really good to see 
her again.</P>
<P class=post>The worst part of the night was having to deal with Kyle and his 
ex-fiancee Jessica discussing their relationship and everything else. I think 
everything is worked out in a decent way now, so what needed to be said was 
hopefully said. </P>

<H3>Room Arrangement</H3>
<P>I rearranged my room today. I'll post pics whenever I finish my roll of film 
and have it developed. It's kind of a funky layout, but I think it will work. If 
not, it only takes several hours to clean up and move everything in a room 
around....</P>
<P class=post>I think I'll need a filing cabinet and some kind of shelves. Also, 
while this layout is good in some ways, I won't get very good speaker output 
with my desk where it is. Oh well. </P>

<H3>Differential Equations Suck</H3>
<P>I've spent about 20 hours in the last three days staring at some ugly 
differential equations, and I have come to the conclusion that they do, in fact, 
suck.</P>
<P class=post>Of course, part of the problem is that I've been working on exact 
solutiont to the Navier-Stokes equations. Sure, they may describe all fluid 
flow, but they are very ugly, and impossible to solve analytically except in 
certain cases. Instead of taking that fact to heart and using numerical or 
emperical solutions, we seem to be wasting a lot of time on actually solving 
some of those few solvable cases.</P>
<P class=post>While this exercise might be useful for a theorist, I can't see it 
being truly useful in actual engineering work. </P>

<H3>What Is Your Middle Earth Name?</H3>
<P>I thought <A href="http://www.barrowdowns.com/middleearthname.asp">this</A> 
was amusing. According to the Red Book, I am a Confused Bounder, my Elven name 
is Vardahriveion, my Hobbit name is Ilberic Hornblower from Frogmorton, my 
Dwarven name is Garin Clawtears, and my Orcish name is Snikwakh the Tough. I 
like those names.</P>
<P class=post>I ran a bunch of friends' names through as well. The character 
descriptions are definitely the best part. Alex is Valiant Longbeard, 
apparently. The most uncannily accurate one is certainly Lisa's though. 
According to the Red Book of Westmarch, Lisa Marie Homstad was an Irritating 
Elven Maiden. Try it yourself, if you don't believe me. </P>

<H3>Weekend Wrap Up</H3>
<P>I thought I would quickly go over what I planned to do this weekend and what 
I actually did. I planned to spend a good deal of time Saturday and today 
studying for my thermodynamics test, which is tomorrow. In reality I went to the 
library yesterday, read Ayn Rand's Anthem (concluding that it was indeed the 
inspiration for Rush's 2112) and started Snow Crash. Today I woke up and read 
Snow Crash until I was finished and then tutored Liz. So I got nothing done, and 
now tonight I'm going to try to cram, which will continue through tomorrow 
morning (but not all night). Then there will be the test. Then I will try to 
finish the homework for 538. Maybe things will slow down a bit after that, but I 
doubt it. </P>

<H3>Cooking</H3>
<P>Robert and Elizabeth stopped by earlier today. I have a somewhat noble goal 
of learning to cook in my head, and they've been cooking for themselves for 
years. Liz filled several pages in one of my notebooks with tips and recipes, 
and Robert had seemingly endless ideas for ways to make good homemade food 
without much effort. Now all I need is some money and a trip to the grocery 
store. I feel that I won't be able to really improve the quality of my living 
situation until I learn to do more than buy cheap nasty premade food.</P>
<P class=post>Now I'll need to find somewhere to eat. </P>
<H4>20:21</H4>
<H2>25 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>In The Beginning Was The Command Line</H3>
<P>I've decided to read <EM>Snow Crash</EM>, by Neal Stephenson, but neither 
library in town has it checked in right now. While I was waiting (I put a hold 
on it) I decided to see what else he had written, and I ran across <EM>In The 
Beginning Was The Command Line</EM>. Somehow that title was very familiar, and I 
when I read the sample excerpt on Amazon I realized that I had already read it, 
and in fact still have a copy of it in html form. I don't actually know if it's 
the entire text or not, but it seems complete.</P>
<P class=post>I kept it around because he talks about Ames and his computer 
science class at Ames High School, which is a pretty direct connection to my 
life (though I attended AHS many years later).</P>
<P class=post>Anyways, if you're curious and have time to read, <A

photographs</A> from the three hour adventure Andy and I took to find the ledges 
last Saturday. It is now documented, and I'm going to take a break. Those might 
get tweaked and edited a bit yet, but for now I'm satisfied. </P>

<H3>Ledges Trip Photos</H3>
<P>No, they're not up yet, sorry. Scanning is a giant pain in the ass and I 
didn't have the patience for it tonight. I did however get them back, and I'm 
quite impressed with the results. My camera seems to be working flawlessly now. 
I forgot how nice it is to have a working light meter. The flash even 
synchronizes properly with the shutter. I'm very happy. </P>
<H4>22:22</H4>
<H3>High School Photos</H3>
<P>I scanned 25 or so photographs I took back in high school. These are some of 
my favorites, though there are others somewhere that I really like as well. I'll 
have to sort through more things to see what is and what isn't in my photo 
albums.</P>

<H3>Streaming Lecture vs Real Life</H3>
<P>Maybe it should be <EM>steaming lecture</EM>?</P>
<P class=post>Ross and I watched the live stream of our Thermodynamics lecture 
today instead of actually going to class. I don't think I learn any more or less 
this way, since class is a pointless waste of time in this case. Nelson expects 
us to do 2 or 3 hours of homework a night, yet seems unable to even give the 
examples he plans to do in class a once-over. The stream affords the me 
advantage of being able to talk freely, call the professor an asshole, flip him 
off, etc without getting in trouble. Ross spent most of the lecture looking at 
somethingawful and pricing a PC he wants to build. How productive we are. </P>

<H3>Andy's Shots are Up</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.symposed.com/pictures/img072">Go check out today's 
adventures.</A> </P>
<H4>19:40</H4>
<H3>Photography, Et Cetera</H3>
<P>I think today I realized something profound. The trip is more fun when you 
don't know where you're going. Andy and I had a plan to head to the Ledges to 
take photos and hike around and stuff. Problem was we weren't paying attention 
to the road signs and it had been so long since either of us had been there that 
we overshot it by at least 15 miles. We ended up in Grand Junction, where we 
found the remains of a building that was completely destroyed by fire and was 
still smoldering. Hopefully Andy will put up couple shots on his page 
tonight.</P>
<P class=post>After that we took a random highway and eventually ended up in 
Perry. I don't think I've ever been there before, but it was a really pretty 
small town. Andy will hopefully have some pics of that as well. You'll have to 
wait a few days before I get anything posted (the only bad thing about film that 
I can see).</P>
<P class=post>We eventually ended up in Jester Park and saw a whole flock of 
white birds on the Des Moines River. It was really neat.</P>
<P class=post>After retracing our path (second time of the day) we finally found 
the Ledges. On one of the trails we met an older gentleman who was shooting 
pictures with as EOS-1 (complete with battery grip). He then showed us the 
EOS-1d and his lenses that he also had with him. Very nice equipment, and 
definitely an enthusiast.</P>
<P class=post>So anyway, it took us three and a half hours to get to a place 
that should be less than a half hour away, and because of it we saw a lot of 
really good things we would have otherwise missed. </P>

<H3>Sam's Stunt</H3>
<P>So I wanted Sam to move his G4 out of the living room. I gave him crap for a 
while but it was on and off and I hadn't said anything in a while, so when he 
finally moved it back into his room I assumed that he finally understood what I 
was getting at. Little did I know that he would take this to the next level. 
Last night he moved his TV, his stereo, his nintendos and everything else of his 
out of the living room and set it all up in his bedroom. Now it <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/lr.jpg">looks like we really haven't even 
moved in</A>, and we're essentially wasting half of the apartment.</P>
<P class=post>Whatever; it's his stuff.</P>
<P class=post>All I wanted was to have a place where we could live, not just a 
playground full of toys. Even better, it looks like everyone but Alex finds this 
really funny. Thanks guys. Alex at least knows what's going on here.</P>
<P class=post>&lt;c&gt; You can't just buy toys all the time. Steve is probably 
frustrated because he wants a nice home but doesn't have the money 
to<BR>&lt;c&gt; on the flip side you do but are unwilling, but he can't say 
anything because on balance most of the stuff is yours.</P>

<P>From: Alex Leigh &lt;aleigh@tessier.com&gt;<BR>Date: Wed Sep 17, 2003 
08:51:27 US/Central<BR>To: macd@cuttingedge.org</P>
<P class=post>Dear cutting edge,</P>
<P class=post>As a representative of evil I would like to let you know that you 
have some information that is factually incorrect on your web page. There is so 
much to choose from, but choose we must, so today we choose &gt; this:</P>
<P class=post>"Astral Projection -- Defined: "Leaving the physical body and 
traveling to another location or reality" [New Age Dictionary]. Potter: "They 
don't need the car!" said Ron impatiently. "They know how to Apparate! You know, 
just vanish and reappear at home!" [p. 69]"</P>
<P class=post>In reality, Astral Projection is the act of projecting one's soul 
from their body either to the astral plane as a destination or through the 
astral plane to another point in space. However, only the soul travels; the body 
remains behind wherever it was in a sleep or coma-like state. Common signs of a 
projected person are a grey pallor, shallow, soft breathing, and a repressed 
cardiac rate.</P>
<P class=post>This is partly your misrepresentation of Rowling's mistake; you 
both have confused Teleportation with Projection. I'll leave it between your 
parties to decide who is the wronger of the two.</P>
<P class=post>Please correct your page, though; as informative as it is, it's a 
wonderful source-book for the young to learn the delightful possibilities.</P>

<H3>Major Server Issues</H3>
<P>Our server, Diesel, is dead. Andy took it home and it probably won't be 
serving any pages for a long time now.</P>
<P class=post>The network in the office Diesel hid in is dead and Andy decided 
that it was time to turn it into his PC. So long, Diesel! You will be 
missed.</P>
<P class=post>Until I get something figured out this page probably won't be 
updated much. It's running off a cable connection in our apartment, which has a 
pretty poor upstream pipe. That means no photo galleries for now (sorry). I 
imagine that quite a few of the links on the right don't work either </P>

<H2>14 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Canon Stuff</H3>
<P>I just got a couple rolls of film back from Wal-Mart. Their one-hour 
processing sucks, but all I was really looking for was if the shutter issues 
with the Canon T70 were resolved and also to see how well the exposures matched 
with my older Minolta SRT100 at the same settings. Everything seems to work 
quite well. I might scan a few examples later, but for now I'm satisfied.</P>
<P class=post>The only thing left to check is flash sync, but that will not only 
involve using my flash, but another as well, since I'm not quite certain that 
the hot shoe of my old Vivitar works properly. </P>

<P>It's finally falling. What has it been? A month? Two? I don't even remember. 
It's good to have some moisture, to feel the air cool down, to have a clean

happy for the rain. </P>

<H3>What The Hell?</H3>
<P>A few minutes ago my wireless connection outright died for no good reason. I 
reset the WAP a couple times, and my network would appear, but only for a 
second. I rashly reset the whole thing, at which point the internet died for the 
non-wireless machines, because I apparently reprogrammed the original MAC 
address for the WAP incorrectly. It is off by a single hex digit on the last key 
from the hardware default. Essentially I made the problem worse. I fixed the MAC 
issue but I still couldn't see the WAP. When I change to a channel other than 6 
it appears instantly, but if I change it to channel 6 the connection just 
disappears. What the heck is going on here? </P>

<H3>Steve's New Theory of Music Appreciation</H3>
<P>If it touches you in some way, it's worth listening to, no matter what your 
friends tell you. If you later come to hate the song and wish you had never 
liked it, that just means you're changing, like everyone does. Musical 
preference is not static. </P>

<H3>Happy Birthday</H3>
<P>Happy birthday to Ross and Sam. They are both X years old, where X is a

<H3>Cable Modem Info</H3>
<P>I just found the information page for my cable modem (where the modem reports 
its status). The modem says that the connection is limited to 1500000 bps (1.5 
Mbps), which is almost exactly what is reported by the <A 
href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest">DSLReports speed test</A>. The upstream 
connection is restricted to 128000 bps (128 kbps), also almost exactly what is 
reported by the speed test. It's nice to know that our connection is running 
pretty much at full bore most of the time. Power and SNR ratings seem good too.

<H3>Redhat 9</H3>
<P>I switched the old Dell to Redhat 9 from Gentoo. I kept the home directory, 
which has all my files in it, so I haven't lost anything there. I just felt like 
trying something new, since I wasn't really doing anything with the machine 
anyways. Not sure if it really matters that I have X running, since it'll be 
headless in the end again. Oh well. </P>

<H3>I Made My First iTunes Music Store Purchase</H3>
<P>I bought a Rick Wakeman album I have wanted for a long time. It only cost 
$5.94 because it only has six tracks. The Music Store is really easy to use, and 
with the cable internet connection I didn't have to wait very long at all.</P>

<H3>I Moved My Stuff</H3>

<H3>In Search Of A Better Browser</H3>
<P>It's fairly obvious that <A 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino">Camino</A> isn't really being 
updated anymore. I hear that there are only a couple people working on the 
project now. Camino is/was great, and I hope that development picks back up, 
because it is a top-notch program and fits with OS X so well. Unfortuately it 
has also been crashing a lot on me as well, and is several versions behind in 
the Mozilla trunk.</P>
<P class=post>I decided to try <A 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird">Firebird</A>, since it's so very 
very nice on Windows and Linux, but since it uses its own UI it doesn't fit in 
with OSX very well and still feels slow. It also feels fairly rough around the 
edges.</P>
<P class=post>So in the end I'm goign to give Safari 1.0 another try. It is 
stable and the UI fits with the OS and is snappy. <A

<H3>Ebay Is Nuts</H3>
<P>Last night I was looking at a Canon A2e body with a not great but decent 
lens, and I decided to place a bid on it. At 2 minutes to the end of the the 
auction the price was $201 and had been that for a good long while. By the time 
I managed to submit my $252.50 bid, the price had jumped up to above that. The 
winning bid was $288.88. It's amazing how fast the bids come in after a certain 
point. No wonder it seems hard to win an auction there. <A

<H3>LKS and Oh My God</H3>
<P>It was a good show last night. I'm glad I finally saw Oh My God, and wish 
that I had made one of their shows last year. The keyboardist was really cool, 
and the drummer was really good. The singer had a good voice as well, though he 
was a little strange.</P>
<P class=post>LKS did well. As seems to be common they started off kind of rusty 
and then got into it as the songs went on. I've noticed the same thing at bigger 
concerts, so it's nothing unusual.</P>
<P class=post>I think I'm going to start yelling "Remain Standing" at every LKS 
show until they play it. </P>

<H2>28 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>T70 Update</H3>
<P>I shot another roll on the camera today. I figured out how to restart the 
rewinding process. It's supposed to count the frames down as it goes, but for 
some reason it doesn't seem to work right. I hit rewind this time and it started 
rewinding, but the frame counter stopped moving back. I pushed the shutter 
release and winding started again. Based on the motor noise and vibration I 
thought that the film was completely rewound, but the frame counter still read 
16. I went back and used my backpack as an emergency darkroom, and opened the 
camera. It looks like the machine rewinds ok, and it advances and counts frames 
accurately, but it doesn't properly sense movement of the film in reverse, so it 
thinks there is a problem and stops rewinding. Since I can sense the change in 
the motor movement I don't see why rewinding will be an issue, as long as I pay 
attention to what I'm doing.</P>
<P class=post>I have plans to develop the film today (1 hour photo, probably) to 
check the camera's movement and metering capabilities. Hopefully it takes 
pictures just fine. I also plan to find a service manual so I can find out how 
the camera knows what frame it's on while it is rewinding the film. Maybe I can 
fix it, or maybe I'll just live with it. As long as the film makes it back into 
the canister and the exposure program is accurate, this is a far better machine 
than the Minolta. </P>

<P>I shot a roll of film with the T70 today. Everything worked just fine, until 
I rewound the film. Somehow it didn't rewind all the way (the camera actually 
seemed to know, because the display read 24 and I think it's it's supposed to 
count all the way back to one and then go blank). I opened the back and noticed 
that I probably hosed the whole roll. I'll have to figure out if there's a way 
to restart the rewinding process after it stops. I have another roll in there 
now, and I plan to go out tomorrow to take more pictures. It's quite possible 
that this is either a one-time deal, or I messed something up. I'll post an 
update when I know. </P>

<H3>Canon T70</H3>
<P>At the <A href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~centrals/isusurplus.htm">Used 
Possession Sale</A> today I encountered a Canon T70 SLR with a 50mm F/1.8 Canon 
FD lens included for $50. For that price I figured it was worth the "as-is" risk 
associated with the sale. After wading through 2 and a half hours of class I 
finally got home, put batteries in, and loaded up a roll of film. The camera is 
kind of loud, but appears to work exactly the way it is supposed to. I think it 
might actually be the same model camera that my uncle Ron has had for years. 
Sure this guy is 19 years old, but the light meter seems to work, and for 50mm 
work this will definitely replace the Minolta. I can safely stow my dreams for a 
modern professional SLR away for later, when I save up more money. </P>

<H3>Cheating "Musicians" Piss Me Off</H3>
<P><A 
href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030825.gtsinging/BNStory/Technology/">This 
is cheating</A>. I am thankful that most of my favorite music doesn't appear to 
use this crap. I can tell because they are far from perfect vocally, and that's 
OK. Believe it or not I respect that, and it should be obvious that no one is 
perfect all the time. </P>
<H4>15:57</H4>
<H3>School Started Again</H3>
<P>I'm not sure if I'm going to like it or not. Maybe once I get my research 
started things will seem cooler, but right now it just feels like undergrad 
again, except harder. </P>

<H3>Another Successful Trip To Kansas City</H3>
<P>Happy birthday to Adam, Catina, and Scott. Thanks to Scott for loaning me his 
couch for the night. It's odd to be back in Ames, knowing that I'm going to 
start school again tomorrow. I thought I was done the first time. </P>
<H4>23:11</H4>
<H2>22 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Old Site Update</H3>
<P>I checked again. It's really quite terrible. I think it must have been 1995 
or 1996 when that went up. I can't change it now, because I don't remember the 
password, and my former contact email is long since dead. </P>
<H4>01:26</H4>
<H3>My First Web Site</H3>
<P>I checked to see if the first website I ever created still exists. It does, 
but I have mixed feelings of excitment and terrible, terrible shame. The site is 
awful, with a bad background, stupid content, terrible design, and godawful MIDI 
soundtracks. I was so proud of my use of frames. Now I'm proud that I don't use 
them.</P>

<H3>Colorado Pictures</H3>
<P>The <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0024">Colorado 
Pictures</A> from this summer are up and available for your viewing pleasure. 
Sorry it took so long, but I lost my digital camera on that trip and had to wait 
for Robert and Liz to stop by with prints from their cameras. Some of these 
photographs were taken by me, but most were either taken by Robert or Elizabeth, 
or were timer shots. Enjoy. </P>
<H4>18:58</H4>
<H3>Open Source</H3>
<P>Alex and I had a discussion yesterday about Open Source software, SCO's 
claims on Linux, and other related things. While I don't want to bring a dead 
argument back to life, I thought that I would put up a link to one of my 
sources. <A href="http://www.perens.com/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html">You guys can 
judge for yourselves</A>.</P>
<P class=post>An <A 
href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1227128,00.asp">interview with Linus 
Torvalds</A> also has some interesting information in it. Of course the stuff 
I've posted is pretty one-sided, but the arguments are strong. </P>
<H4>08:45</H4>
<H2>19 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>KC This Weekend?</H3>
<P>I plan to go, but as of now it doesn't look like anyone else will be coming 
with me. That's just the way it goes I guess. I long to break out of the whole 
all-my-time-in-Iowa thing, and others say the same thing, but go to Minnesota or 
something instead of KC. More often than that they just don't go anywhere.</P>
<P class=post>Now I think it might be time to head to bed, as my powerbook is 
really fucking hot under my left hand. </P>
<H4>22:46</H4>
<H2>18 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>School Update</H3>
<P>I have everything I need to register for classes, get health insurance, and 
get ready for school. It's a relief to know that everything will work out 
properly. I still need to get direct deposit stuff set up so that I can just 
recieve my paycheck, rather than waiting for it and cashing it. I also need to 
fill out a few forms at the Student Health center.</P>
<P class=post>Otherwise, things look good for school. I have some seminar stuff 
tomorrow, and more on Wednesday and orientation is Friday. Yay, or something. 
School is starting again. </P>
<H4>22:01</H4>
<H3>Intarweb</H3>
<P>Now that Diesel is back up I can finally post about our internet connection. 
Mediacom told us that they would be here to set up the internet between 8:00 AM 
and noon on Saturday. We were up early, around 9 or so, and waited for them to 
get here. At about 11:45 we got a call from the installation guy, who said he 
would be here in 15 minutes. He showed up 25 minutes later. Apparently Mediacom 
didn't bother to tell him that we already had a cable modem, because he brought 
one with him. The guy knew what he was doing though, and everything got set up 
just fine. We now have our fine addicting internet, which will waste countless 
hours at the expense of my productivity. </P>

<H3>Party Update</H3>
<P>Alex and Victoria must show up. They are required. </P>
<H4>12:16</H4>
<H2>11 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Housewarming Party Update</H3>
<P>OK, no matter what you fools do to try to get out of it, this Friday evening 
is the date set for our spectacular housewarming party. Everyone who reads this 
is invited, I suppose (though personal friends are given priority and must show 
up on pain of death). Plan to come to 2101 Oakwood Rd. #213 in Ames around 7 or 
so. Earlier is probably OK. We will have food of some kind (working on it) and 
hopefully good times will be had by all. If you want to amplify the party 
atmosphere I recommend bringing a beverage of choice. If you like you can bring 
something like chips or dip or salsa or dessert or anything else you feel will 
enhance the experience. Also, feel free to bring things that are fun, so maybe 
we can play some games (Ben, Andy, I'm thinking like drunken Jenga). Also if 
anyone feels the need to crash we have a pull-out couch and a somewhat soft 
floor, but no extra pillows (plan ahead). </P>
<P class=post>If things go well there may even be intelligent conversation and 
debate. I am now going to name people who have to be there: Andy, Ben, Ross, 
Samm, Lisa. People who should come but will be forgiven because they are a long 
ways away: Dusan. People who are quite welcome to come: Sarah, Tom, Laurence. 
People who I would really like to see come but will forgive them if they don't 
make it because they have to drive a ways: Alex and Victoria. </P>
<P class=post>So plan to show up at our place Friday night at 7. Parking is no 
problem, just find a place in the lot. Any suggestions you might have just send 
to scblock at iastate dot edu or call me at 515 450 2044. </P>
<H4>21:57</H4>
<H2>08 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Got Some More Cooking Stuff</H3>
<P>I bought some new pots and pans this evening. The ones we had had serious 
sticking issues, and I thought it would be good to just go buy some decent ones 
that wouldn't cause problems. After much debate (20 minutes or more) we settled 
on pretty much the exact same pots that my parents have, because they are 
relatively inexpensive and I know how they perform (rather well). Now hopefully 
we'll be able to fry eggs and cook noodles without spending the next 20 minutes 
trying to scrape the remains off of the pans. </P>
<H4>23:58</H4>
<H2>06 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>It's Late, So I'll Be Deep</H3>
<P>Watched Magnolia tonight. I'm not quite sure what to think. I'd like to say 
that it's a good movie, but I'm afraid that would sound pretentious, since I 
really didn't understand a lot of it. It made sense all the way through, until I 
tried to put things together, at which point everything went haywire. There were 
a few things that I really liked though. One of them was Earl's nurse, Phil. He 
was an honest, caring, empathic person. Another was the cop, whose name I can't 
remember. He was another of those honest caring types. I think that those 
characters mean a lot to me because they are the kind of people I wish I was. I 
wish I could be as honest and compassionate as they were. I wonder if it's 
really possible for any of us to change who we are. </P>
<P class=post>Now that I have the deep stuff out of the way, it's time to be a 
little more shallow. I finally drank the bottle of Chimay I bought when I got 
back from KC. It really is good, and the size of the bottle means that little 
else will get done if you drink it. I've also noticed that Sam bought a bottle 
of Shmirnoff and is spiking his Snapple. I don't think he's actually putting 
that much in, but it's still strange to see sam drinking anything. Makes me 
wonder, really. </P>
<P class=post>When I get hold of a good internet connection I plan to go through 
Alex's photo galleries and choose a couple pictures that I really like. We are 
in desperate need of some decoration on these bare walls, and an original work 
of photographic art would be a more interesting way of adding something to the 
apartment than just buying something mass-produced. I'm also considering having 
a few of my photographs blown up so I can put them up as well. </P>
<P class=post>There may also be some plans to have a housewarming party here 
sometime, though I'm not sure when. I kind of want to have a grill and maybe a 
dining table and some chairs first. I'm spending money left and right already 
and I can't afford much, but maybe a good deal will pop up at a garage sale or 
something. Besides if I give enough notice we may get some visitors from KC to 
come as well. If anyone has any good ideas for a date or anything, or has some 
times that absolutely will not work, let me know. The more I know about what you 
are doing then the better any gathering will be. </P>
<P class=post>And that's it for tonight, folks. For more news, stay tuned for 
the next few days or something. </P>

<H3>Kansas City Pictures are Up</H3>
<P>It took forever, but I rescanned the images that I wanted to put up with a 
quality slide scanner yesterday, saving me the trouble of fixing all the dust 
marks that were on the original scans of the prints. Then I had to deal with two 
slow computers making life hell, but it was all worth it. The photographs I took 
with <A href="http://www.tessier.com/">Alex's</A> camera are up, so <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0023">go check them out</A>.

<H4>10:35</H4>
<H2>04 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>We Have Moved In</H3>
<P>There was a lot of stuff to move, and I still have a lot of stuff to sort 
through and put away, but Sam and I now live in our new apartment. We have 
contacted Mediacum, and hopefully we will soon have some internet action going 
on. We have no regular phone, but that's OK because the Verizon reception is 
very good in there.</P>
<P class=post>Soon we will have some kind of house warming party, but I'm not 
quite sure when. If you haven't come over yet, don't feel left out. I haven't 
even managed to sit back and drink a beer yet. </P>

<H3><A href="http://www.symposed.com/">Andy's New Page</A></H3>
<P>I think I like this design. I can read it, and somehow it even screams "Andy" 
even though it's got larger fonts than he's had in years. Good work, Andy. </P>

<H3>Kansas City At Night</H3>
<P>On Saturday night (Sunday morning) Alex took Jen, Bryan, Mike, and myself 
around KC to take some night photographs. Mine will have to wait until the film 
gets developed, but Jen put some up in her gallery. I especially like <A

<H3>Loot</H3>
<P>The last couple days have been full of loot getting. On Friday I finally 
joined the 90s and got a cell phone from Spring Valley Wireless. It's pretty 
sweet and I already have a bunch of phone numbers programmed into it, so I can 
harass all of you more often. My last post has the number, if you want to reach 
me.</P>
<P class=post>The real loot isn't mine, but Sam's, and it happened yesterday. I 
called him around noon asking if he wanted to hang out, and he said he was 
eating with his family but would stop by later. When he pulled up he was driving 
a black Celica and looking happy. He was test driving it, and loved it (even 
though I wasn't so sure about that car). His parents convinced him to think 
about it some more, and Sam and I went off to look at stuff in the Lincoln 
Center strip mall. After that we went down to Des Moines because his parents 
called and said they were at the Toyota dealership down there and wanted him to 
come look at a car. When we got there they were already in negotiations and had 
decided to buy the car. Crazy stuff.</P>
<P class=post>So now I have new loot, and he has even more new loot. It was a 
loot filled day indeed. </P>

<P>I'm learning some things, though the ability to write something simple like 
reading a list of the files in a directory into an array, list or file and then 
comparing that list to a similar list created from another directory still 
eludes me. Something tells me it's extraordinarily easy, but I am an 
inexperienced scripter/coder. By the time I figure this out I think I'm going to 
have the task that I plan to code this for done. </P>

<H3>Another Wedding Today</H3>
<P>Emily Olson got married this afternoon. That's two weddings in as many days. 
It was a very short (20 minutes) ceremony, and the food at the reception was 
excellent. All in all it was very nice, though Sam had a rough time of it near 
the end. Poor guy.</P>
<P class=post>Jeff and Foy showed up late. Apparently John Bessman also got 
married today as well, and they were at that wedding. Way to go John!. </P>

<P>Actually if I remember correctly they are at the courthouse right now doing 
whatever it is you do to get hitched in a civil ceremony. I've got to run off 
and get ready for the reception now. Hopefully it won't be boring, or I'll have 
to make excuses and jet out of there.</P>
<P class=post>One more wedding tomorrow, then one day of work, then Colorado.

<H3>Looks Like I'm Going To Colorado</H3>
<P>Somehow or another Robert managed to convince me to come with him (and his 
soon-to-be-wife Elizabeth) to Colorado on a ten-day hiking and climbing and 
backpacking and camping trip. I don't know how good and idea this really is, but 
I just spent $200 on gear. I'll also have to take almost 2 weeks off of work, 
which will cost me a lot more money. </P>
<P class=post>I don't know whether to be excited or pissed off at myself. </P>

<H3>Recompiling...</H3>
<P>I'm recompiling Diesel's kernel right now. Hopefully that will improve the 
performance of the machine some. I just found out that DMA wasn't on. If the new 
kernel still doesn't turn DMA on automatically I'll add the commands to do so to

much. </P>

<H3>Friday The 13th</H3>
<P>It's Friday the 13th, but I'm not scared.</P>
<P class=post>Sam and I looked at two bedroom places in Oakwood apartments 
today. I was quite impressed, and I really can't think of anything I saw that I 
didn't like. The living rooms were large and wide open, the bedrooms were of a 
decent size, there were decks, kitchens with dishwashers, closets, and other 
things. I have a feeling that we're going to take a room in this place, and all 
that we have to decide is whether to live on the ground level or the second 
level. I'd like to live on the terrace level because it has huge decks, but no 
suchk luck because it's all full already.</P>
<P class=post>I hope I can afford this, I've never had to pay for a place to 
live <EM>and</EM> go to school at the same time. </P>

<H3>I'm Getting There</H3>
<P>Slowly but surely I'm getting things lined up and worked out for fall. Maybe 
even by the end of the week I'll know where I'm going to live and have 
everything ready for getting into grad school. I sure hope everything works out 
the way I planned it to. </P>

<H3>Andy, Where Are You?</H3>
<P>I haven't seen <A href="http://andy.iowadvd.com/">Andy Buck</A> in quite a 
while. I haven't talked to him or even seen him online in days. <A 
href="http://www2.iastate.edu/~benjanke">Ben</A> said that he was on IRC for a 
while on Thursday, but I must have missed him. I called him twice on Thursday, 
but never got a response. I even tried stopping by his place with no luck. So 
where is he?</P>
<P class=post>He hasn't updated his main page in a while either, but I noticed 
that there are some new galleries put up that are dated June 6. I think that 
means that we can assume that Andy has <EM>not</EM> died, contrary to popular 
conjecture. My best guess is that he went off to Iowa City, but didn't tell 
anyone about it. He's probably been in a drunken stupor for the past three days 
or so. It would be just like him if that was true.</P>
<P class=post>We love you anyway, Andy. </P>

<H3>Scary Skies Over Ames</H3>
<P>There were some really cool clouds over Ames today around noon. The sky to 
the north was pretty much black. I took some photos with a digital camera at 
work. <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0022">Check them

<H3>Rearrange Your Life</H3>
<P>The grand rearrangement project has begun in the basement. So far I've moved 
the small entertainment center from the west wall to the north, turned the futon 
around, and moved a bunch of my crap out of the main walking area. I have the 
receiver hooked up and running, and I've attached the Sony speakers, DVD player, 
and TV.</P>
<P class=post>One of the big things I did was move the Dell over to the 
entertainment center and hook it up to the receiver. With the help of X11 and 
X-Forwarding over SSH I use the PowerBook to control the Dell. Since the link 
between these two computers is through a wireless router, I can control what 
music is playing on the receiver from anywhere in the house. It works 
<EM>very</EM> well. Right now I use xmms to play the music, but my goal is to 
find a nice console based music jukebox and use that instead, so that I can open 
a screen session and run the jukebox in there. That would allow me to start up 
some music and detach the session with the music still playing. That appears to 
be impossible with xmms.</P>
<P class=post>I had a whole crap load of stuff that had no good storage options, 
so I went shopping for plastic storage with Sam. We found some nice Rubbermaid 
stuff at Lowe's, and i bought two large shallow containers, one large deeper 
container, and a media case. Now all my DVDs, video games, and random cables are 
pretty well organized and easy to move around. Hopefully that will get me 
started on controlling my insane overflow of random crap. I still have the 
deeper container to put stuff in, but the other three containers are completely 
full.</P>
<P class=post>I should just get rid of some of my crap. </P>

<H3>Golf</H3>
<P>Robert is back in town, and today seemed like the perfect day to inaugurate 
another season of bad golf play. We decided to play Homewood, like always, and 
headed out there around 1:00 PM. A word of caution to those who haven't been out 
there on a weekend yet this year: nine holes is now $14.50 on the weekend. 
That's really too much for a marginal 9-hole course, and I think I'm going to 
have to go out and find a nicer course that doesn't charge so much. I think 
there are some nice 18-hole courses around here that run about $20, which would 
be a much better deal. Anyway, today was a day for excellent tee shots and 
terrible approach shots. On almost ever hole I hit a long straight drive 
(usually with a 3-iron) that landed either near or on the fairway. I then 
proceeded to cock it up badly. For example on the sixth hole i landed 20 feet 
from the green on my first shot and hit it right over by about 30 yards.</P>
<P class=post>I usually don't even bother to hit my woods when I golf, since I 
tend to have a wicked slice that is only amplified by the low lofted clubs. I 
tried my 1-wood on the seventh hole anyway, and I drilled the ball well over 230 
yards, and straight to boot. That meant of course that I was off the fairway to 
the left, since I usually aim left to somewhat counteract the slice. Then I 
tried the 5-wood on #8 and hit it a good 200 yards, straight and high. Maybe I'm 
starting to gain some control over the drivers. It really doesn't matter though, 
because I can't putt to save my life.</P>
<P class=post>Ben, Ross, and anyone else who wants to go, lets set up a golf 
outing sometime soon. </P>
<H4>16:49</H4>
<H2>30 May 2003</H2>
<H3>Summer...</H3>
<P>Well, two weeks of summer down, some more to go. My job is going OK like 
always, but I definitely need a change. The Next Big Thing I do will probably be 
to actually get enrolled at ISU again. I honestly didn't expect to be doing 
this, even a month ago. Life just comes as it does, I guess. </P>
<P class=post>In other work news, I now get to drive the tractors around. It's 
like people trust me or something. I can also drive the skid steer loader, and 
for stupid/ignorant people who don't know what that is (because you really do 
even if you don't recognize the name) <A 
href="http://www.newholland.com/nh/skidst.htm">here is a link</A>. The loader at 
work looks exactly like that (though we have several custom made attachments in 
addition to the standard bucket). So Liz, Sam, etc: that is a skid steer loader, 
and you <EM>have</EM> seen one before, because they hang around this town all 
the time. </P>

<H3>Wireless?</H3>
<P>I got a Linksys Wireless Router (802.11g) today. It's doing a fine job with 
the minimal tasks I have set so far, which is pretty much just networking the 
desktop Dell with the PowerBook without having to have the PB plugged into 
anything. I have Samba set up so I can access the files stored on the Dell from 
anywhere in the house, and everything works just fine. Now all I need is a 
decent internet connection so I don't have to go find a phone line any more.

<H3>BMW</H3>
<P>Andy let me take his BMW home with me last night. I drove it around for a 
good bit, and it is the fastest car I've ever driven. That really doesn't say 
much for the cars I've driven, I guess, but it sure was a lot of fun. Now I 
understand part of the reason he drives the way he does. The way that car 
accelerates and handles, and the way it always seems to have more power just 
waiting for you makes it almost impossible to not cock off in it. </P>

<P>I got pissed off at the internet at home, so I decided to come to campus and 
use the superior internet here instead. Right now I'm in 139 Durham, but it's a 
very pleasant night and i think I might head outside to enjoy it, while sitting 
on the interent. I know it seems silly, but it really is a nice night to sit 
outside and do some internet stuff, and that is where wireless comes in handy. 
Besides, I didn't feel like plugging in anyways. </P>

<H3>Xbench Freaked Me Out</H3>
<P>I ran Xbench on my PowerBook after I got terrible performance in the UT2003 
demo. It was almost unplayable, and I remembered some sluggishness earlier when 
I was using the machine. Then I ran Xbench and got an overall score of 53.41 and 
almost freaked. I wondered if my Al was somehow really slow. Then i remembered 
power management stuff, and it turns out that I have been running with the 
processor set to "Reduced Performance" for two days. I set that before I left to 
save battery life during the car ride to Missouri, but I really didn't need that 
setting enabled any more. I turned the processor back to full speed. and my 
scores jumped to 73.89, which is right in the middle of the average 12" 
PowerBook scores. My UT framerates shot way up as well. </P>
<P class=post>I guess the moral of the story is if your Mac laptop seems 
sluggish, check the power management settings before you freak out about having 
problems with the computer. </P>

I have the photos from <A

<P class=post>Also, here is an edited photo of my little cousin Erica. Yes, I 
used a filter, but I also made extensive use of layers, levels, curves, and 
color balance tools as well, so I'm not totally lame.</P>

<H3>Angela Hoffman's Graduation, Weston Missouri</H3>
<P>This weekend was a 'big' family trip down to Weston to see Angie and the rest 
of the Hoffmans. Angie is graduating from West Platte High School today as a 
co-valedictorian. Of everyone who is probably reading this page, I think that 
only Sam has met her before. She showed us around Weston a bit when Sam and I 
came down to see Rush at the Sandstone ('Verizon Wireless') Amphitheater.</P>
<P class=post>Our trip started on a somewhat sad note. We first went down to Des 
Moines on Saturday morning to see my little sister Anne play a soccer game. The 
got beat pretty bad. Annie and my Dad stayed home because she had two more games 
to play this weekend. That meant that only four of us, the three 'big kids' and 
our mom, went to Weston. </P>
<P class=post>Weston was just as nice as I remembered it, a tiny little town 
with narrow streets and a lot of hills. People are friendly and there are a lot 
of neat old buildings, as well as a thriving downtown. It's really a very 
interesting town, with a lot of good photographic opportunities. I feel like I 
should stop there again on my next Missouri photographic trip. Actually I might 
take some of you along too. There's a bar there that Andy absolutely 
<EM>has</EM> to see. Maybe Sam would even feel like visiting again. He could get 
another espresso at the candy shop.</P>
<P class=post>We arrived around 3 P.M., about two hours before the official 
start of the graduation party. In typical fashion, things weren't ready by then. 
In atypical fasion, my cousin Greg and uncle Ron were in a rush to finish the 
new patio. At least I don't think most people are working to get brickwork done 
an hour before the guests are scheduled to arrive. Everything came together 
nicely though, and they got the white sand laid in between the bricks with ample 
time to spare.</P>
<P class=post>The party was pretty much your typical graduation party. i spend 
most of my time downstairs or on the patio with a beer or pop. I'm not really a 
fan of the crowded party thing where you don't know most of the people. I got to 
spend some nice time with my uncle Tom's children, especially Emily and Erica. 
Poor Emily is nine but has to follow the rules of a two year old because Erica 
follows her around everywhere. I got some nice photos of the both of them, which 
should all be in a new gallery I'll put up soon.</P>
<P class=post>My cousin Greg has purchased a lot in Weston and intends to build 
a new house there. He'll first probably have to tear down the old run-down shack 
that's there right now though. I'm sure that whatever he builds will be quite 
interesting. The front of the lot is a pretty good hill, while the back is more 
level and is set back in the trees. The back of his land juts up against a state 
park, so he should never have to worry about annoying neighbors there, either. 
Add all that to the fact that he is an architect, and i think we can expect a 
unique and original dwelling. Well, it had better be unique.</P>
<P class=post>The highlight of the night though was probably O'Malley's Pub in 
downtown Weston. From the outside it looks like a tiny little building, but the 
real pub is actually about three floors down in an old wine cellar. It is quite 
frankly amazing. I really wish I had brought my camera with me to that place. I 
know that a wine cellar three floors down in the middle of an old town sounds 
kind of like a dank and musty place but it is actually very nice. The walls and 
ceiling are of old stone, and the ceiling has a high arch to it. There are two 
levels in the bar itself, and every weekend they have live music. It's neat to 
find a place like that in a small town, especially since it's so well hidden 
away. Going there is like finding out a great little secret. Andy has to see it 
sometime.</P>
<P class=post>And the coolest part about the trip? I'm writing this now on my 
brand new 12 inch PowerBook G4, which I earlier used to import and edit the 
photos I took this weekend with my digital camera. I used the slideshow feature 
of iPhoto to show my pictures to my extended family, and everyone gathered 
around to see. I think that next time I do something like this I should carry 
the TV dongle with me so that I can run the side show on the television, tough. 
The PowerBook certainly didn't make me cooler, but it did allow me to do some 
very nice things on this trip. Now I think I'm going to plug in my Grados and 
listen to some music. With the sun shining the way it is I have the backlight 
down pretty much all the way and the 'Book estimates about four hours of life 
yet, so it should be able to get me home before it needs to be charged. I'm 
quite happy about this purchase. </P>

<P>I have a 12" powerbook, and it is tiny, and gorgeous, and sexy, and silver,

excited about the whole thing. SO COOL! </P>

able to just purchase it oughtright by July, but I want it now, and this will

come back to it. I spent most of my time away in <A

project deserve some credit, becuase it's a very nice system. Still, I was using 
a conglomeration of apps that never quite fit together. Now that I'm back using 
KDE i realized how much I really like Konqueror, KMail, KEdit, etc. The only 
program I used a lot that I really like better than the KDE version is <A 
href="http://aterm.sourceforge.net/">aterm</A>, and I've solved that problem by 
changing my old Konsole keyboard shortcut to launch aterm instead. </P>

<P>I've been playing around. I think I like this, but you can tell me what you 
think as well. All of you guys should know my email address by now. </P>

<P class=post>I think that the edit is quite nice in a washed out and wonderful 
sort of way. Make your own judgement though. </P>

<H3>I Want To Shoot Film Again</H3>
<P>I was looking through my photo albums, which I recently updated and sorted 
out, and I think that I really like the look of color film. I think that I need 
to start shooting on film again. If I had a light meter I might give slides a 
try, but I don't. What I really need is a camera with smooth action and a good 
metering system. <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/srt100.jpg">My 
Minolta</A> unfortunately does not have either. I might have to see if my dad 
will let me borrow his Olympus OM-1 again. Otherwise I'll just have to get an 
AE-1 in good condition and a couple lenses. </P>

<H3>We Got Some Sparc</H3>
<P>Andy and I, in a very strange and incorrect state of mind, ended up buying <A 
href="http://129.186.194.3/~abuck/gallery2/sparc">Sun Sparcs and a DEC VT240</A> 
from the UP today. Of course we don't have the proper keyboard to use 
<EM>any</EM> of the machines. In other words it was a pretty ghetto and silly 
thing to do. Even so I am now the proud owner of a <EM>dual</EM> 50 MHz 
SparcStation 10. </P>

<H3>I Might Move Away From KDE</H3>
<P>It is somewhat slow. I feel like delving deeper into the more UNIX like 
nature of Linux. I'm trying WindowMaker right now. No verdict just yet on how I 
feel about it. </P>
<P class=post>Don't get me wrong, I still like KDE. I'm just changing things 
around like I always do, and I thought it was time for a change. </P>

<H3>Birthdays And Stuff</H3>
<P><A href="http://www2.iastate.edu/~samewong">Wong</A> had a bit of a birthday 
party at his place and it was a good time. Doc Wong is a master on the grill, 
and Anne makes great vegetables like beans and potatoes. We watched Hero, which 
is awesome. I want to see it again. The cinematography just blew me away. </P>
<P class=post>I think <A href="http://www2.iastate.edu/~abuck">Andy</A> put up

though it would be good to document the snowstorm. </P>

<H3>If You Haven't Noticed...</H3>
<P>There's a new layout here. It's not <A

for</A>, but I think it will do OK. The only ways I can think of to get it just 
like I want is to either use a different content management system that was more 
flexible, rewrite the current one, or use cheap hacks and broken code to try to 
fix it. The first option would be a hassle, and the second would require 
knowledge of perl. The last would just be worthless.</P>
<P class=post>This should work just fine for now, though. </P>

<H3>A New Look For KDE</H3>
<P>I tossed my KDE appearance settings around last night to make them smoother 
and slicker. It's pretty flat now, but it looks nice and is easy on the eyes. I 
pretty much made everything smaller (fonts, icons, window borders). I think I 
like this, and now my IRC windows take up 1/3 of the screen instead of 2/3. </P>

<H3>This Is Odd</H3>
<P>The University sent me an email yesterday about financial aid, so I went to 
AccessPlus and checked on it, and now I'm apparently eligable for a couple loans 
(like the Stafford Loan). This is the first time that's ever happened. It's very 
strange, and I have school already paid for, and it's the middle of the 
semester. </P>

<H3>There Ought To Be A Test</H3>
<P>Before people are allowed to use computers, or, god forbid, the internet, 
they should have to pass an intelligence test. You should be able to spell, use 
punctuation properly, and maybe even be able to score a D in grammar. A 
requirement to read documentation before asking stupid questions would be good 
as well. I'm tired of idiots on message boards asking questions that have been 
answered well in the documentation. I'm tired of people complaining when things 
don't work only to find out that they haven't even looked at the instructions on 
how to do it. I'm tired of people who don't bother to take a minute to look 
something up before wasting other people's time. Essentially, I'm tired of 
people like this: </P>

<P>I beat Chrono Trigger tonight. I had not beaten it before, but only made it 
to the last chapter of the story. Now I've done the whole game, including all 
the side quests that cryptic guy at the end of time was talking about. I have 
now finished Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, but it's too bad that I did them 
out of order. Oh well, I paid better attention this time through anyway, and

<H3>Kansas City Photos Are Up</H3>
<P>All the pictures I took with the digital camera are now up in a <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0016">new gallery</A>. Some of 
the photos are pretty cool, but most are pretty much just touristy snapshots. 
Hopefully I got some good shots with my <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/srt100.jpg">Minolta SLR</A>. I haven't 
used it in a long time. </P>
<P>The man who showed us around KC yesterday is Alex Leigh. He's a really nice 
guy and a heck of a photographer. Thanks Alex for being so generous. You should 
all check out <A href="http://www.tessier.com/">his site</A> and his photo 
galleries, because he's a better photographer than I am. </P>

<H3>Kansas City Rules!</H3>
<P>We are in our second day in KC, and having a hell of a time. We're at this 
guy named Alex's place, who we only met in person for the first time today. He 
is very cool, and much like Andy he is a mac guy with a crapload of electronics. 
He showed us around downtown this afternoon. It's been a pretty sweet trip 
overall. </P>
<P>The weather out here is absolutely amazing. It's about 77 degrees and sunny. 
The best part is all the "spring break" type places like California and Florida 
are rainy and snowy right now. The best weather in the entire US is in the 
midwest! </P>

<H3>I Like the BeOS</H3>
<P>I know it's dead, but the BeOS is still one of the greatest operating systems 
ever made. In most areas its usability still far exceeds that of Linux, even 
though Linux is still in active development by hundreds of people.</P>
<P>I wiped my Redhat partition yesterday and put the BeOS R5 in its place. I 
like it better than Redhat already. I can't decide if I should keep using BeOS 
or switch back to Linux. I guess I have a choice since both the BeOS and Linux 
are still installed. </P>

<H3>Holy Hell I'm Done</H3>
<P>I finished my 415 project. I finished it. I finished it on time. Holy shit 
this is weird, because now I'm not working on it. I feel like i just handed 
Gassman my ass, but it doesn't matter anymore because it's out of my hands. I 
spent 14 hours over the past two days on this shit, and over 60 hours total and 
I still think it's pretty crappy in places. </P>
<P>But who cares? </P>
<P>IT'S DONE DAMMIT. </P>
<H4>16:10</H4>
<H2>05 Mar 2003</H2>
<H3>This is a Crappy Week</H3>
<P>But after tomorrow I'll be done with IE 408 (other than the last take home 
test). Somehow I might even manage to get my Solidworks done so that I can turn 
in my 415 project, but I'm not so sure about that. Even so I don't think I'm 
going to worry too much. I'll just try to get it done. </P>
<P>In other news, I don't think I've updated on the printer situation in a 
while. On a whim on Sunday afternoon I pulled open the Memory Expansion slot on 
the side of the Laserjet III (the one that works). Lo and behold there was a 
memory expansion card, which should have meant that I had enough memory to 
properly print in Linux. I pulled it out and blew it off, then plugged it back 
in and made sure it was firmly seated. Then I turned the printer back on and 
watched it pass a self test. A subsequent test print proved that the the RAM was 
now properly installed and working. I can now print perfectly, and the only 
problem I get is some feed issues that I think are caused by the incredibly dry 
air in this room. </P>
<P>Let me tell you, a working laser printer, even a 300 DPI one, kicks the shit 
out of any inkjet when printing black and white documents (95% of what I print). 
What's even cooler is that I got this whole thing set up for $23, which is about 
$5 less than it would have cost for me to just replace my empty black ink 
cartridge. </P>

<H3>Lyrics and Music for Everyone</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.steveblock.com/Storm.mp3">This is a great song</A>, and I 
can't wait until it's mastered and released so i can buy it (straight from 
Canada). I think it's the first time Devin Townsend has mentioned his wife Tracy 
by name in a song.</P>
<P>The best part is that he doesn't use any of that damn computar correction on 
his voice, so all the flaws that make it so human are there. Somehow it sounds 
better when it's not perfect.</P>
<P>By the way, these lyrics are based on what I can hear when I listen to the 
song, so no guarantees that it's perfectly correct. <BR><BR><EM><STRONG>Devin

<H3>Unix Is Great</H3>
<P>After an unsuccessful attempt to find a Linux distribution better than <A 
href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</A> I decided it was time to just give up 
and install Gentoo again. The problem with this idea was that I had (still have, 
actually) homework to get done and I needed a working Operating System to do it. 
I solved this little dilemma by using <A 
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">Knoppix</A>: a bootable 
Linux CD that autodetects hardware and loads up a fully functional <A 
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>-based Linux system with a whole 
crapload of programs ready to run. It doesn't even need a hard drive to work. 
</P>
<P>So with Knoppix I got a working Linux system running <A 
href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 3 that I could use to get my work done, AND 
install Gentoo in a little terminal window on the corner of the desktop AT THE 
SAME TIME! Computer things just don't get very much cooler than that. </P>
<H4>01:08</H4>
<H3>A Printer UPdate</H3>
<P>Quite a bit has happened with the laser printer situation since my last 
printers post. Since then I have combined the two nonworking fusers into one 
perfectly functional fuser. I still had some streaking problems, but I figured 
those out as well. I bought a Laserjet II at the UP sale on Wednesday. It had a 
toner cartridge and many functional parts, but otherwise was nothing special. I 
put that toner into the Laserjet III and lo and behold it worked perfectly. So 
as of this moment I have one very functional HP Laserjet III, one mostly 
functional Laserjet II, and a nonfunctional Newgen TurboPS/630.</P>
<P>My new printer project is to get the Newgen working because, unlike the two 
HPs, the Newgen does PostScript. I pulled the fuser out of the "new" Laserjet II 
and shoved it into the Newgen, but the printer won't feed paper properly. Paper 
only gets a couple inches in before it stops moving. The problem appears to be a 
worn pickup roller, so I'm going to TRY to swap it out with the roller from the 
Laserjet II as well. I have a working printer, but it's nothing special. If I 
could have a working PostScript printer, however, it would kick ass, since (at 
least in Linux) PostScript is much better supported. </P>

<H3>I Don't Like Printers</H3>
<P>The first printer I bought didn't work because of grinding gears. I bought 
another one last week and it worked but it printed with a lot of streaks and 
ghosting and other crap. I was attempting to clean it up when i noticed that the 
fuser had a big tear it in. That explained why I was getting poor fusing. I 
swapped one of the fuser gears over to the fuser from the other printer I bought 
and installed that one, but there were still grinding noises (though different 
from before) and the printer therefore still didn't work. I then started pulling 
the fuser apart to see if I could swap the rollers. It might be possible, but it 
will take a long time, as there are a <EM>lot</EM> of screws and i'm pissed off 
anyways.</P>
<P>Anyhow, here's a nice picture of the printer and fuser in their current state 
of glory.</P>

<H3>Somehow I Make It Every Time</H3>
<P>Last night I pretty much had no hope that I could get my assignments for 
today done on time. I spent four hours in the computer lab last night getting 
next to nothing done, and then two more hours at home working on a different 
assignment. Somehow I got second assignment done and I already turned it in. The 
first assignment is a large progress report for my design class. I don't know 
what I'm doing in that class, but somehow I managed to make a progress report 
that is actually not half bad. I'm not even quite sure how I did it. I don't 
think the numbers are quite right but that's OK because I got it mostly done. 
I'll have some time in class today to finish it up and print it out. </P>

<H3>Guess What</H3>
<P>I'm going back to Gentoo. I'll figure my damn memory problems out on my own. 
Even Debian feels fucked up to me. Portage is the greatest collection of scripts 
and programs EVER. I mean it. I've never found anything quite so cool. </P>

<H3>Most Linux Distros Are Bullshit</H3>
<P>I was having major memory leak issues with my Gentoo system, so I thought it 
might be a good time to try something new. I have now tried Redhat 8, Slackware 
8.1, and VectorLinux 3.2. In the past I've used just about every other distro as 
well. So far they all suck for one very important reason: they don't deal with 
dependencies. Slackware feels out of date, Redhat is too newbie oriented, and 
VectorLinux can install programs automatically but forgets to get the proper 
program dependencies. I'm fed up with the whole deal. Tonight I think I'm going 
to try to install Debian (I've never done that successfully). If I can't get 
that working I'm going back to Gentoo. I guess that most distribution people 
think that making the system "newbie friendly" or getting a great system 
installer is more important than having a great update and software installation 
system. </P>

fast. But of course these people probably "could care less" anyway. </P>

<H3>Oh Man the 12" Powerbook is Cool</H3>
<P>I went to the <A href="http://www.mpc.iastate.edu/">MPC</A> today to demo the 
powerbook that I want so very much. It is a very impressive little piece of 
hardware. In fact the only hardware cooler than it was the tablet PCs, but they 
all run Windows. I want OSX! Somehow I have to get the money to get that thing.

<H3>Gnome 2.2 Is Nice</H3>
<P>Gnome 2.2 finally came out, and it's actually quite nice. A lot of big 
applications have yet to be ported to GTK2, but I've got my fingers crossed that 
that will happen soon. Gnome 2.2 feels quite a bit more complete than Gnome 2.0 
did, but I still feel that the preferences section leaves something to be 
desired. There's just not quite enough customizability. Still, I like it a lot, 
and I plan to use it for a while so that I can make a fair comparison with KDE 
3.1. </P>
<P>I took a screenshot of my current desktop running Gnome 2.2. Sam might notice 
that I've replaced an older version of Gaim with a prerelease CVS version 
(0.60cvs) of Gaim that uses GTK2 instead of the older GTK. It actually supports 
font faces and antialiased text now, and it just plain looks prettier 
overall.</P>

<H3>Super Fun With NFS</H3>
<P>I figured out some more NFS related stuff, and now my website files are 
accessable to my main computer via NFS. This will hopefully be a little bit 
easier than using SSH to log in and edit files when I want to make a new post. 
Of course, I plan to keep using SSH so that I can post updates from almost any 
computer with internet access. </P>

<P>You guys who didn't go missed out. The first band that played (narcotic- 
something or other) was a boring crappy garage band thing. They had maybe ten

On top of that LKS was tight, and their new song is cool. </P>

<H3>Blosxom Does RSS (And So Can You)</H3>
<P>I just found out that the same Blosxom script that runs this entire website 
also handles output in the form of an RSS feed. Feeds of this protocol are used 
to check a site, grab the headlines, and make links to the actual posts or 
articles that the headlines relate to. Although I'm not sure how much use this 
really is, anyone using Ximian Evolution, for example, can try it out. If you 
want to, just go to your Evolution settings and open the Summary Preferences 
window. Under the News Feeds tab hit the 'Add news feed' button and put <FONT 
color=red>http://steve.nofw.org/?flav=rss</FONT> in the URL box. Go ahead and 
name it whatever you like. If you then add the new feed to your Summary page you 
can see the titles of all my posts! </P>

<H3>Today I Ran a Mile</H3>
<P>That might not sound like much, but instead of going to the used possession 
sale like I might have (sorry boys) I went running with Travis instead. I ran my 
first real honest to god unadulterated mile in five or six years. I didn't slow 
down, I didn't stop, I didn't walk, I just kept running. I could even have gone 
a few more laps. I honestly could hardly believe it.</P>

<H3>X-Forwarding Over SSH Is Grrrrreat.</H3>
<P>I love how I can run any program that is on my home machine on any computer 
with an X server and an SSH client. For Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOSX these things 
are either included with various releases or easily obtained for free. In 
Windows, X servers can be bought or obtained freely, depending on the level of 
sophistication needed. SSH clients like PuTTY are readily available for free. No 
matter how you slice it, it is possible for me to run KMail or Konqueror or 
XChat or anything else as long as I have a network connection.</P>
<P>The best performace has to be with a *nix machine running XFree86 on a good 
LAN connection. Right now I am in the Black Engineering computer lab on a Redhat 
7.3 machine and I am running several of my KDE apps on this machine. I honestly 
can't tell by look or feel that these programs are not local. This is just plain 
amazing.</P>
<P>I'm sure Andy will enjoy this when he's running stuff off of his new AMD 
FreeBSD 5.0 machine on his Quicksilver. </P>

<H3>KDE 3.1 Is Out!</H3>
<P>At least, on the 3.1 page they have 3.1 binaries, there was a post on 
OSNews.com, and portage says 3.1 is available and unmasked. I started compiling 
it and some of its dependencies around 8:00, so I should have it done probably 
by Wednesday afternoon. Sometimes I wonder why I go with this source-based 
distro instead of RedHat or something. But then I think of how well I understand 
this system and how I managed to avoid all the crap that I was forced to deal 
with otherwise.</P>

<H3>I Feel Like Crap</H3>
<P>I am getting a nasty cold now. I felt crappy all day, so I went to bed not 
long after I got home, and I woke up around 7. The problem is that now I'm not 
really sure what day it feels like. It's hard to fathom that 12 hours ago I was 
in class, when it feels like days have passed.</P>
<P>I got ME 490 added, so I can now drop IE 361. I need to go do that soon, 
since I really don't want to keep taking it, and I haven't gone to it since last 
Wednesday anyway.</P>
<P>I am not a good dancer. I was under the influence of wine and whiskey at the

<H3>I Need to Get Out of Windows!</H3>
<P>I'm at work, trying to use Photoshop to edit some photographs that appear to 
have been lost before they made it to the proper image directory. I need to open 
them, check the embedded file information, change anything that's necessary, 
rotate or crop them as necessary and save them back to the network. 
Unfortunately, our server runs Windows, and my computer runs Windows, and I just 
need to get out. I need a *nix machine fast. A MacOS X machine would be best, 
but at this point I'll take my computer and the Gimp. Photoshop is completely 
dead, explorer just crashed, I can barely move around the network, and the hard 
drive is thrashing like crazy. </P>

<H3>Nimda is Funny</H3>
<P>It might not be funny if you're a Windows user and you don't have decent 
antivirus protection, or if you run an IIS server and haven't patched it yet, 
but seeing the characteristic exploits used by nimda in your Apache server log 
on your FreeBSD server is kind of funny. </P>
<P>I can't laugh too loudly though, since new security exploits are being found 
all the time. Also, I remember last summer when I set up a Windows 2000 based 
router that I mistakenly allowed IIS to install itself on. I had nimda in less 
than 12 hours. I think now and in the future my servers will stick to safer 
software than IIS. </P>

<H3>Jesus Lives!</H3>
<P>That's right folks. Jesus is up and running FreeBSD, serving NFS, and pretty 
much kicking some major ass. Andy and I are doing admin stuff, and we're going 
to try to get Jesus' 17 gig drive shared over NFS on himac. I've had to get Andy 
to stop raping Jesus a few times, but overall he's taking our abuse very well. 
If any of you want an account on Jesus, like if you want to learn about unix or 
BSD or you just like having accounts, just email me or message me or 
something.</P>
<P>Yes, Jesus truly is a god.</P>
<P>We may start serving web pages off of Jesus soon, but that's kind of up to 
Andy, since between us we would then have three web servers. We'll see. </P>

<H3>What Kind of Crap is This?</H3>
<P>Andy's internal network adapter died. Then he bought a NIC and it didn't 
work. Then he took the NIC from his old PC, which I have right now. It didn't 
work either. Then he bought a "Mac OS 10.2 compatible" PCI network card. That 
doesn't work either. To top it all off, the drive he ordered from the CD-R/RW 
section of a web site turned out not to be a CD-R or CD-RW, but an ordinary 
CD-ROM. The poor guy has nothing but trouble with his ultra-powerful machine. It 
sucks ass. </P>

<H3>School Started Again... And It Still Sucks</H3>
<P>That's right. I started class again bright and early at 8:00 this morning. My 
first professor seems like an alright guy, but he is quite boring. The class is 
about solving differential equations using the finite element method, and no, 
that does not mean using something nice and pretty like CosmosWorks but instead 
something wholly evil, like MATLAB. Uck.</P>
<P>I'm still trying to set up a 490 with Dr. Pate so that I can drop this dumb 
Quality Control class that I signed up for so that I could get my scholarship 
money. I can't wait to graduate and get out of here. I'm just about burned out 
on classwork. </P>

<H3>New Photo Gallery</H3>
<P>Thanks to Andy, I now have a picture gallery set up on himac. It's very cool. 
As soon as I figure out how to get Gallery Remote working on my machine (it 
complains about some missing libraries that aren't missing at all) I'll put a 
bunch more pictures up. Right now I have the original gallery that Andy set up 
and some pictures from my trip to Colorado. I'm also working on a new cam pic, 
so soon you will see it up on Sam and Lisa's cam pages. </P>

<H3>I'm Running Out of Time</H3>
<P>It's Thursday. I have to pretty much make sure all my things are in order by 
tomorrow so that we can go skiing. Unfortunatley I feel like I have a million or 
so things to do before then, and when we get back it's time for school to start 
again. I really wish this ski trip was time more like RAGBRAI. That trip was in 
the middle of summer, so I had ample time both before and after the trip to 
enjoy myself. Now I'm just worried about finding a class for next semester, 
making sure I have enough money for this trip and to finish school, etc. I'm not 
so certain that I really can have much fun now. Besides that, I don't really 
have "proper" ski equipment. I don't know how much money is too much to spend or 
what is really necessary anyway. If only there was another week of break, so 
that I felt like I could come back and relax a bit before starting school up 
again. </P>
