    <P>
      Fed up with wet and warm winters in Britain, John and I decided the time had come to look elsewhere.
      Our requirements were simple: short walk-ins, reliable ice, no rain and quality country and western.
      So plans were made and in January 2004 John landed at Boston Logan airport for two weeks of climbing
      frozen water, getting cold and top notch radio.
    </P>

    <h3>
      Sunday 18th January : Stairs Falls
    </h3>

    <P>
      As was to be expected, things didn't go exactly to plan.
      Ten minutes out of Boston on I93 the car started to shake violently and we soon found ourselves stopped
      on the shoulder with a blown tyre.
      Great.
    </P>

    <p align="center">10:58am : John looking guilty and wondering what or who will break next</P>

    <P>
      The plan was to climb at The Flume, a gorge twenty minutes from the road in Franconia Notch.
      After hiking up the trail for an hour, we were convinced that the guide book's directions were wrong
      and that there was no time to make it to The Flume.
      Fortunately, we came across Stairs Falls, and decided to play there instead.
    </P>

    <h3>
      Monday 19th January : The Flume
    </h3>

    <P>
      Ignoring the guide book and following the huge highway signs for Flume Visitors' Center", we soon found the
      right spot and spent the day top-roping various climbs and forgetting to take pictures.
    </P>

    <hr>
    <h3>
      Tuesday 20th January : Champney Falls
    </h3>

    <P>
      Today saw more top-roping and ludicrously low temperatures - we were the only ones to brave the conditions
      for more than one climb.
    <P>

    <h3>
      Thursday 22nd January : The Flume II
    </h3>

    <P>
      We drove back to Boston on Tuesday night to thaw ropes, mend our broken tent, and repair John's foot.
      After a day recouperating, we returned to the flume for some steep ice action.
      We climbed the pillar on the left, then decided to take on the hanging ice curtain.
      After I'd hauled myself straight up the front, John decided on a more devious route up the back.
    </P>

      Friday 23rd January : Kinsman Notch
    </h3>

    <P>
      Our first day leading - a grade 2, a 2+, a 3 and then something round about a 3+ in the dark while
      Steve quielty freezes to death belaying.
      Shame we forgot to take any photos in all the excitement.

      Saturday 24th January : Mount Washington
    </h3>

    <P>
      On Friday night we met up with Cruftlabs people and friends for a night of luxiourious indulgence at a motel.
      Our hundred-dollar single-glazed unheated room for two proved slightly better value for money with six of us
      sleeping in it.
      Today wasn't quite the hardcore Mount Washington summit attempt we'd expected, but turned out to be a high-altitude,
      low-temperature sledging trip instead.
    </P>

    <h3>
      Tuesday 27th January : Mount Washington II
    </h3>

    <P>
      We'd planned to climb at Frankenstein today, but the weather was too perfect to waste down low.
      By the time we got to North Conway we could see the summit of Mount Washington and it was just too tempting to ignore.
    </P>

      Forty-eight hours previously, the weather on Mount Washington was comparable to that on Everest.
      Somehow we felt a little cheated!

      Wednesday 28th January : Frankenstein Cliff
    </h3>

    <P>
      Today's plan was to climb Standard Left on Frankenstein as a warm-up before attempting the area's classic Standard Route.
      The route was great, but sadly took us all day, and of course we forgot to take the camera on the climb.
    </P>

      Thursday 29th January : Frankenstein Cliff II
    </h3>

    <P>
      Feeling refreshed after a night in the Best Value Hotel in the Whole World Ever (TM), we returned to Frankenstein for Standard Route.
      And mighty fine it was too.

    <P>
      After completing Standrd Route in a more respectable four hours, we decided to squeeze in another route before dark.
      Needless to say, the day ended with more abseiling by braille.
    </P>

      Friday 30th January : Frankenstein Cliff III
    </h3>

    <P>
      With bruised knuckles and a howling wind, we decided to finish off the trip with some more top-roping.
      We returned to Frankenstein and after leading a short pitch at Trestle Cut Flows, played around on some steep thin ice.
    </P>
