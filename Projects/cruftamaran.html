      <h2> The Cruftamaran </h2>

      <p> As my first experience with Cruftlas July 4th raft building, Geddy and I built the Cruftamaran.
          Our objective was to build something large enough to allow several people to sleep onboard, but which was sleek enough to be paddled efficiently.
          The design principle was to push the boundaries of Cruft raft building - curved surfaces.
