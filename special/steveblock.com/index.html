<H3>The Other Steve Block</H3>
<P><A 
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Steve+Block&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Search 
Google for Steve Block</A> and you'll find quite a few people that I share my 
name with, but they tend to be fully grown boring people like I'll end up as 
someday. There's another Steve Block though who owns <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.co.uk/">http://www.steveblock.co.uk/</A>, and from 
the look of things my life comes in a distant second to his. I'm not sure how to 
feel about this. Somehow it means more that he appears to have lived a more 
exciting life than me just because we share a name.</P>
<P class=post>Just check out his photo galleries and you'll see what I mean.

<H3>Sam's Stunt</H3>
<P>So I wanted Sam to move his G4 out of the living room. I gave him crap for a 
while but it was on and off and I hadn't said anything in a while, so when he 
finally moved it back into his room I assumed that he finally understood what I 
was getting at. Little did I know that he would take this to the next level. 
Last night he moved his TV, his stereo, his nintendos and everything else of his 
out of the living room and set it all up in his bedroom. Now it <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/lr.jpg">looks like we really haven't even 
moved in</A>, and we're essentially wasting half of the apartment.</P>
<P class=post>Whatever; it's his stuff.</P>
<P class=post>All I wanted was to have a place where we could live, not just a 
playground full of toys. Even better, it looks like everyone but Alex finds this 
really funny. Thanks guys. Alex at least knows what's going on here.</P>
<P class=post>&lt;c&gt; You can't just buy toys all the time. Steve is probably 
frustrated because he wants a nice home but doesn't have the money 
to<BR>&lt;c&gt; on the flip side you do but are unwilling, but he can't say 
anything because on balance most of the stuff is yours.</P>
<P class=post>Alex, you're exactly right. </P>

<H3>C Says</H3>
<P>From: Alex Leigh &lt;aleigh@tessier.com&gt;<BR>Date: Wed Sep 17, 2003 
08:51:27 US/Central<BR>To: macd@cuttingedge.org</P>
<P class=post>Dear cutting edge,</P>
<P class=post>As a representative of evil I would like to let you know that you 
have some information that is factually incorrect on your web page. There is so 
much to choose from, but choose we must, so today we choose &gt; this:</P>
<P class=post>"Astral Projection -- Defined: "Leaving the physical body and 
traveling to another location or reality" [New Age Dictionary]. Potter: "They 
don't need the car!" said Ron impatiently. "They know how to Apparate! You know, 
just vanish and reappear at home!" [p. 69]"</P>
<P class=post>In reality, Astral Projection is the act of projecting one's soul 
from their body either to the astral plane as a destination or through the 
astral plane to another point in space. However, only the soul travels; the body 
remains behind wherever it was in a sleep or coma-like state. Common signs of a 
projected person are a grey pallor, shallow, soft breathing, and a repressed 
cardiac rate.</P>
<P class=post>This is partly your misrepresentation of Rowling's mistake; you 
both have confused Teleportation with Projection. I'll leave it between your 
parties to decide who is the wronger of the two.</P>
<P class=post>Please correct your page, though; as informative as it is, it's a 
wonderful source-book for the young to learn the delightful possibilities.</P>
<P class=post>Live short and painful lives,</P>
<P class=post>Alex Leigh </P>

<H3>Major Server Issues</H3>
<P>Our server, Diesel, is dead. Andy took it home and it probably won't be 
serving any pages for a long time now.</P>
<P class=post>The network in the office Diesel hid in is dead and Andy decided 
that it was time to turn it into his PC. So long, Diesel! You will be 
missed.</P>
<P class=post>Until I get something figured out this page probably won't be 
updated much. It's running off a cable connection in our apartment, which has a 
pretty poor upstream pipe. That means no photo galleries for now (sorry). I 
imagine that quite a few of the links on the right don't work either </P>
<H4>20:29</H4>
<H2>14 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Canon Stuff</H3>
<P>I just got a couple rolls of film back from Wal-Mart. Their one-hour 
processing sucks, but all I was really looking for was if the shutter issues 
with the Canon T70 were resolved and also to see how well the exposures matched 
with my older Minolta SRT100 at the same settings. Everything seems to work 
quite well. I might scan a few examples later, but for now I'm satisfied.</P>
<P class=post>The only thing left to check is flash sync, but that will not only 
involve using my flash, but another as well, since I'm not quite certain that 
the hot shoe of my old Vivitar works properly. </P>
<H4>20:29</H4>
<H2>13 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Another Year, Another Game</H3>
<P>We lost to Iowa this year. The team just wasn't very impressive today. We'll 
get the Cy-Hawk trophy back next year though, I hope. </P>

<H3>Rain</H3>
<P>It's finally falling. What has it been? A month? Two? I don't even remember. 
It's good to have some moisture, to feel the air cool down, to have a clean 
smelling breeze blow through my room. We need the moisture so badly, too. I'm 
happy for the rain. </P>
<H4>21:17</H4>
<H2>10 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>What The Hell?</H3>
<P>A few minutes ago my wireless connection outright died for no good reason. I 
reset the WAP a couple times, and my network would appear, but only for a 
second. I rashly reset the whole thing, at which point the internet died for the 
non-wireless machines, because I apparently reprogrammed the original MAC 
address for the WAP incorrectly. It is off by a single hex digit on the last key 
from the hardware default. Essentially I made the problem worse. I fixed the MAC 
issue but I still couldn't see the WAP. When I change to a channel other than 6 
it appears instantly, but if I change it to channel 6 the connection just 
disappears. What the heck is going on here? </P>
<H4>21:10</H4>

<H3>Steve's New Theory of Music Appreciation</H3>
<P>If it touches you in some way, it's worth listening to, no matter what your 
friends tell you. If you later come to hate the song and wish you had never 
liked it, that just means you're changing, like everyone does. Musical 
preference is not static. </P>
<H4>18:23</H4>
<H3>Happy Birthday</H3>
<P>Happy birthday to Ross and Sam. They are both X years old, where X is a 
variable between 22 and 24 (I'm guessing 23). Sam is older, but Ross has a more 
vibrant hair color. Happy birthday guys. </P>
<H4>15:03</H4>
<H2>08 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Brownies</H3>
<P>I'm making Alex's brownie recipe. I sure hope it turns out. Once i master 
dessert I'll need to move up to side dishes or something. Heh, I'll learn to 
cook somehow. </P>
<H4>20:18</H4>
<H2>07 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Cable Modem Info</H3>
<P>I just found the information page for my cable modem (where the modem reports 
its status). The modem says that the connection is limited to 1500000 bps (1.5 
Mbps), which is almost exactly what is reported by the <A 
href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest">DSLReports speed test</A>. The upstream 
connection is restricted to 128000 bps (128 kbps), also almost exactly what is 
reported by the speed test. It's nice to know that our connection is running 
pretty much at full bore most of the time. Power and SNR ratings seem good too. 
</P>
<H4>12:48</H4>
<H2>06 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>Redhat 9</H3>
<P>I switched the old Dell to Redhat 9 from Gentoo. I kept the home directory, 
which has all my files in it, so I haven't lost anything there. I just felt like 
trying something new, since I wasn't really doing anything with the machine 
anyways. Not sure if it really matters that I have X running, since it'll be 
headless in the end again. Oh well. </P>
<H4>12:38</H4>
<H2>05 Sep 2003</H2>
<H3>I Made My First iTunes Music Store Purchase</H3>
<P>I bought a Rick Wakeman album I have wanted for a long time. It only cost 
$5.94 because it only has six tracks. The Music Store is really easy to use, and 
with the cable internet connection I didn't have to wait very long at all.</P>
<P class=post>I'm going to have to be careful; this could turn into an 
addiction. </P>

<H3>I Moved My Stuff</H3>
<P>I moved my computer setup from the too-tall drafting table in the living room 
to the too-flimsy computer desk in my room. Its all part of a grand plan to 
convince Sam that his desktop machine needs to go back in his room.</P>
<P class=post>It'll also be easier to look at teh nekkid ladies on teh intarweb.

<H4>22:53</H4>
<H3>In Search Of A Better Browser</H3>
<P>It's fairly obvious that <A 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino">Camino</A> isn't really being 
updated anymore. I hear that there are only a couple people working on the 
project now. Camino is/was great, and I hope that development picks back up, 
because it is a top-notch program and fits with OS X so well. Unfortuately it 
has also been crashing a lot on me as well, and is several versions behind in 
the Mozilla trunk.</P>
<P class=post>I decided to try <A 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird">Firebird</A>, since it's so very 
very nice on Windows and Linux, but since it uses its own UI it doesn't fit in 
with OSX very well and still feels slow. It also feels fairly rough around the 
edges.</P>
<P class=post>So in the end I'm goign to give Safari 1.0 another try. It is 
stable and the UI fits with the OS and is snappy. <A 
href="http://www.symposed.com/">Andy</A> can just shut up and let me use the 
browser I choose, if he pleases. </P>

<H3>Ebay Is Nuts</H3>
<P>Last night I was looking at a Canon A2e body with a not great but decent 
lens, and I decided to place a bid on it. At 2 minutes to the end of the the 
auction the price was $201 and had been that for a good long while. By the time 
I managed to submit my $252.50 bid, the price had jumped up to above that. The 
winning bid was $288.88. It's amazing how fast the bids come in after a certain 
point. No wonder it seems hard to win an auction there. <A

<H3>LKS and Oh My God</H3>
<P>It was a good show last night. I'm glad I finally saw Oh My God, and wish 
that I had made one of their shows last year. The keyboardist was really cool, 
and the drummer was really good. The singer had a good voice as well, though he 
was a little strange.</P>
<P class=post>LKS did well. As seems to be common they started off kind of rusty 
and then got into it as the songs went on. I've noticed the same thing at bigger 
concerts, so it's nothing unusual.</P>
<P class=post>I think I'm going to start yelling "Remain Standing" at every LKS 
show until they play it. </P>
<H4>13:10</H4>
<H3>Shutter Problems</H3>
<P>Shutter &gt; 500 doesn't open correctly. 500 is iffy.</P>

<H2>28 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>T70 Update</H3>
<P>I shot another roll on the camera today. I figured out how to restart the 
rewinding process. It's supposed to count the frames down as it goes, but for 
some reason it doesn't seem to work right. I hit rewind this time and it started 
rewinding, but the frame counter stopped moving back. I pushed the shutter 
release and winding started again. Based on the motor noise and vibration I 
thought that the film was completely rewound, but the frame counter still read 
16. I went back and used my backpack as an emergency darkroom, and opened the 
camera. It looks like the machine rewinds ok, and it advances and counts frames 
accurately, but it doesn't properly sense movement of the film in reverse, so it 
thinks there is a problem and stops rewinding. Since I can sense the change in 
the motor movement I don't see why rewinding will be an issue, as long as I pay 
attention to what I'm doing.</P>
<P class=post>I have plans to develop the film today (1 hour photo, probably) to 
check the camera's movement and metering capabilities. Hopefully it takes 
pictures just fine. I also plan to find a service manual so I can find out how 
the camera knows what frame it's on while it is rewinding the film. Maybe I can 
fix it, or maybe I'll just live with it. As long as the film makes it back into 
the canister and the exposure program is accurate, this is a far better machine 
than the Minolta. </P>
<H4>13:42</H4>
<H2>27 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Slight Problem</H3>
<P>I shot a roll of film with the T70 today. Everything worked just fine, until 
I rewound the film. Somehow it didn't rewind all the way (the camera actually 
seemed to know, because the display read 24 and I think it's it's supposed to 
count all the way back to one and then go blank). I opened the back and noticed 
that I probably hosed the whole roll. I'll have to figure out if there's a way 
to restart the rewinding process after it stops. I have another roll in there 
now, and I plan to go out tomorrow to take more pictures. It's quite possible 
that this is either a one-time deal, or I messed something up. I'll post an 
update when I know. </P>
<H4>21:30</H4>
<H3>Canon T70</H3>
<P>At the <A href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~centrals/isusurplus.htm">Used 
Possession Sale</A> today I encountered a Canon T70 SLR with a 50mm F/1.8 Canon 
FD lens included for $50. For that price I figured it was worth the "as-is" risk 
associated with the sale. After wading through 2 and a half hours of class I 
finally got home, put batteries in, and loaded up a roll of film. The camera is 
kind of loud, but appears to work exactly the way it is supposed to. I think it 
might actually be the same model camera that my uncle Ron has had for years. 
Sure this guy is 19 years old, but the light meter seems to work, and for 50mm 
work this will definitely replace the Minolta. I can safely stow my dreams for a 
modern professional SLR away for later, when I save up more money. </P>

<H3>Cheating "Musicians" Piss Me Off</H3>
<P><A 
href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030825.gtsinging/BNStory/Technology/">This 
is cheating</A>. I am thankful that most of my favorite music doesn't appear to 
use this crap. I can tell because they are far from perfect vocally, and that's 
OK. Believe it or not I respect that, and it should be obvious that no one is 
perfect all the time. </P>
<H4>15:57</H4>
<H3>School Started Again</H3>
<P>I'm not sure if I'm going to like it or not. Maybe once I get my research

again, except harder. </P>

<H3>Another Successful Trip To Kansas City</H3>
<P>Happy birthday to Adam, Catina, and Scott. Thanks to Scott for loaning me his

start school again tomorrow. I thought I was done the first time. </P>

<H2>22 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Old Site Update</H3>
<P>I checked again. It's really quite terrible. I think it must have been 1995 
or 1996 when that went up. I can't change it now, because I don't remember the 
password, and my former contact email is long since dead. </P>
<H4>01:26</H4>
<H3>My First Web Site</H3>
<P>I checked to see if the first website I ever created still exists. It does, 
but I have mixed feelings of excitment and terrible, terrible shame. The site is 
awful, with a bad background, stupid content, terrible design, and godawful MIDI 
soundtracks. I was so proud of my use of frames. Now I'm proud that I don't use 
them.</P>

<P>The <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0024">Colorado 
Pictures</A> from this summer are up and available for your viewing pleasure. 
Sorry it took so long, but I lost my digital camera on that trip and had to wait 
for Robert and Liz to stop by with prints from their cameras. Some of these 
photographs were taken by me, but most were either taken by Robert or Elizabeth, 
or were timer shots. Enjoy. </P>

<H3>Open Source</H3>
<P>Alex and I had a discussion yesterday about Open Source software, SCO's 
claims on Linux, and other related things. While I don't want to bring a dead 
argument back to life, I thought that I would put up a link to one of my 
sources. <A href="http://www.perens.com/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html">You guys can 
judge for yourselves</A>.</P>
<P class=post>An <A 
href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1227128,00.asp">interview with Linus 
Torvalds</A> also has some interesting information in it. Of course the stuff 
I've posted is pretty one-sided, but the arguments are strong. </P>

<H3>KC This Weekend?</H3>
<P>I plan to go, but as of now it doesn't look like anyone else will be coming 
with me. That's just the way it goes I guess. I long to break out of the whole 
all-my-time-in-Iowa thing, and others say the same thing, but go to Minnesota or 
something instead of KC. More often than that they just don't go anywhere.</P>
<P class=post>Now I think it might be time to head to bed, as my powerbook is 
really fucking hot under my left hand. </P>
<H4>22:46</H4>
<H2>18 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>School Update</H3>
<P>I have everything I need to register for classes, get health insurance, and 
get ready for school. It's a relief to know that everything will work out 
properly. I still need to get direct deposit stuff set up so that I can just 
recieve my paycheck, rather than waiting for it and cashing it. I also need to 
fill out a few forms at the Student Health center.</P>
<P class=post>Otherwise, things look good for school. I have some seminar stuff 
tomorrow, and more on Wednesday and orientation is Friday. Yay, or something. 
School is starting again. </P>
<H4>22:01</H4>
<H3>Intarweb</H3>
<P>Now that Diesel is back up I can finally post about our internet connection. 
Mediacom told us that they would be here to set up the internet between 8:00 AM 
and noon on Saturday. We were up early, around 9 or so, and waited for them to 
get here. At about 11:45 we got a call from the installation guy, who said he 
would be here in 15 minutes. He showed up 25 minutes later. Apparently Mediacom 
didn't bother to tell him that we already had a cable modem, because he brought 
one with him. The guy knew what he was doing though, and everything got set up 
just fine. We now have our fine addicting internet, which will waste countless 
hours at the expense of my productivity. </P>
<H4>09:03</H4>
<H2>13 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Party Update</H3>
<P>Alex and Victoria must show up. They are required. </P>
<H4>12:16</H4>
<H2>11 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Housewarming Party Update</H3>
<P>OK, no matter what you fools do to try to get out of it, this Friday evening 
is the date set for our spectacular housewarming party. Everyone who reads this 
is invited, I suppose (though personal friends are given priority and must show 
up on pain of death). Plan to come to 2101 Oakwood Rd. #213 in Ames around 7 or 
so. Earlier is probably OK. We will have food of some kind (working on it) and 
hopefully good times will be had by all. If you want to amplify the party 
atmosphere I recommend bringing a beverage of choice. If you like you can bring 
something like chips or dip or salsa or dessert or anything else you feel will 
enhance the experience. Also, feel free to bring things that are fun, so maybe 
we can play some games (Ben, Andy, I'm thinking like drunken Jenga). Also if 
anyone feels the need to crash we have a pull-out couch and a somewhat soft 
floor, but no extra pillows (plan ahead). </P>
<P class=post>If things go well there may even be intelligent conversation and 
debate. I am now going to name people who have to be there: Andy, Ben, Ross, 
Samm, Lisa. People who should come but will be forgiven because they are a long 
ways away: Dusan. People who are quite welcome to come: Sarah, Tom, Laurence. 
People who I would really like to see come but will forgive them if they don't 
make it because they have to drive a ways: Alex and Victoria. </P>
<P class=post>So plan to show up at our place Friday night at 7. Parking is no 
problem, just find a place in the lot. Any suggestions you might have just send 
to scblock at iastate dot edu or call me at 515 450 2044. </P>
<H4>21:57</H4>
<H2>08 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>Got Some More Cooking Stuff</H3>
<P>I bought some new pots and pans this evening. The ones we had had serious 
sticking issues, and I thought it would be good to just go buy some decent ones 
that wouldn't cause problems. After much debate (20 minutes or more) we settled 
on pretty much the exact same pots that my parents have, because they are 
relatively inexpensive and I know how they perform (rather well). Now hopefully 
we'll be able to fry eggs and cook noodles without spending the next 20 minutes 
trying to scrape the remains off of the pans. </P>
<H4>23:58</H4>
<H2>06 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>It's Late, So I'll Be Deep</H3>
<P>Watched Magnolia tonight. I'm not quite sure what to think. I'd like to say 
that it's a good movie, but I'm afraid that would sound pretentious, since I 
really didn't understand a lot of it. It made sense all the way through, until I 
tried to put things together, at which point everything went haywire. There were 
a few things that I really liked though. One of them was Earl's nurse, Phil. He 
was an honest, caring, empathic person. Another was the cop, whose name I can't 
remember. He was another of those honest caring types. I think that those 
characters mean a lot to me because they are the kind of people I wish I was. I 
wish I could be as honest and compassionate as they were. I wonder if it's 
really possible for any of us to change who we are. </P>
<P class=post>Now that I have the deep stuff out of the way, it's time to be a 
little more shallow. I finally drank the bottle of Chimay I bought when I got 
back from KC. It really is good, and the size of the bottle means that little 
else will get done if you drink it. I've also noticed that Sam bought a bottle 
of Shmirnoff and is spiking his Snapple. I don't think he's actually putting 
that much in, but it's still strange to see sam drinking anything. Makes me 
wonder, really. </P>
<P class=post>When I get hold of a good internet connection I plan to go through 
Alex's photo galleries and choose a couple pictures that I really like. We are 
in desperate need of some decoration on these bare walls, and an original work 
of photographic art would be a more interesting way of adding something to the 
apartment than just buying something mass-produced. I'm also considering having 
a few of my photographs blown up so I can put them up as well. </P>
<P class=post>There may also be some plans to have a housewarming party here 
sometime, though I'm not sure when. I kind of want to have a grill and maybe a 
dining table and some chairs first. I'm spending money left and right already 
and I can't afford much, but maybe a good deal will pop up at a garage sale or 
something. Besides if I give enough notice we may get some visitors from KC to 
come as well. If anyone has any good ideas for a date or anything, or has some 
times that absolutely will not work, let me know. The more I know about what you 
are doing then the better any gathering will be. </P>
<P class=post>And that's it for tonight, folks. For more news, stay tuned for 
the next few days or something. </P>

<H3>Kansas City Pictures are Up</H3>
<P>It took forever, but I rescanned the images that I wanted to put up with a 
quality slide scanner yesterday, saving me the trouble of fixing all the dust 
marks that were on the original scans of the prints. Then I had to deal with two 
slow computers making life hell, but it was all worth it. The photographs I took 
with <A href="http://www.tessier.com/">Alex's</A> camera are up, so <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0023">go check them out</A>. 
</P>

<H2>04 Aug 2003</H2>
<H3>We Have Moved In</H3>
<P>There was a lot of stuff to move, and I still have a lot of stuff to sort 
through and put away, but Sam and I now live in our new apartment. We have 
contacted Mediacum, and hopefully we will soon have some internet action going 
on. We have no regular phone, but that's OK because the Verizon reception is 
very good in there.</P>
<P class=post>Soon we will have some kind of house warming party, but I'm not 
quite sure when. If you haven't come over yet, don't feel left out. I haven't 
even managed to sit back and drink a beer yet. </P>
<H4>07:22</H4>

<H3><A href="http://www.symposed.com/">Andy's New Page</A></H3>
<P>I think I like this design. I can read it, and somehow it even screams "Andy" 
even though it's got larger fonts than he's had in years. Good work, Andy. </P>

<P>I've been <A

<P class=post><EM>I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you I'm feeling like a lost

<H3>Kansas City At Night</H3>
<P>On Saturday night (Sunday morning) Alex took Jen, Bryan, Mike, and myself 
around KC to take some night photographs. Mine will have to wait until the film 
gets developed, but Jen put some up in her gallery. I especially like <A 
href="http://www.zoomchick.org/gallery/kansas/IMG_1345_001">this one</A>. It's 
very chill.</P>

<P class=post>To Alex and Victoria, thanks for letting me stay at your place and

<P>It's like playing an FPS, but for real. You can actually shout to your real 
teammates and glance around real corners. You can run strategy and all that too. 
It's one hell of a workout as well. THe only thing I didn't like was the teenage 
douchebags that showed up and started doing the "human shield" thing and jumping 
up and down and just plain being cheating assholes. </P>

I would like to now shout out to <A href="http://andy.iowadvd.com/">Andy</A> and 
<A href="http://www.lisahomstad.com/">Lisa</A>. You two should be here, meeting 
people and having fun. Alex wishes you were and so does Victoria. I would ask

<H3>Loot</H3>
<P>The last couple days have been full of loot getting. On Friday I finally 
joined the 90s and got a cell phone from Spring Valley Wireless. It's pretty 
sweet and I already have a bunch of phone numbers programmed into it, so I can 
harass all of you more often. My last post has the number, if you want to reach 
me.</P>
<P class=post>The real loot isn't mine, but Sam's, and it happened yesterday. I 
called him around noon asking if he wanted to hang out, and he said he was 
eating with his family but would stop by later. When he pulled up he was driving 
a black Celica and looking happy. He was test driving it, and loved it (even 
though I wasn't so sure about that car). His parents convinced him to think 
about it some more, and Sam and I went off to look at stuff in the Lincoln 
Center strip mall. After that we went down to Des Moines because his parents 
called and said they were at the Toyota dealership down there and wanted him to 
come look at a car. When we got there they were already in negotiations and had 
decided to buy the car. Crazy stuff.</P>
<P class=post>So now I have new loot, and he has even more new loot. It was a 
loot filled day indeed. </P>

<H3>More Tcl News</H3>
<P>I'm learning some things, though the ability to write something simple like 
reading a list of the files in a directory into an array, list or file and then 
comparing that list to a similar list created from another directory still 
eludes me. Something tells me it's extraordinarily easy, but I am an 
inexperienced scripter/coder. By the time I figure this out I think I'm going to 
have the task that I plan to code this for done. </P>

<H3>Sony Vaio</H3>
<P><A href="http://www2.iastate.edu/~benjanke">Benny</A> pointed out that Sony 
has a <A href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~benjanke/IMG/sonyripoff.jpg">new 
Vaio desktop case</A> that looks to be in a similar style to the <A

this information, since I've been worrying about it a lot. </P>

<H3>Another Wedding Today</H3>
<P>Emily Olson got married this afternoon. That's two weddings in as many days. 
It was a very short (20 minutes) ceremony, and the food at the reception was 
excellent. All in all it was very nice, though Sam had a rough time of it near 
the end. Poor guy.</P>
<P class=post>Jeff and Foy showed up late. Apparently John Bessman also got 
married today as well, and they were at that wedding. Way to go John!. </P>

<H3>Robert's Getting Married Today</H3>
<P>Actually if I remember correctly they are at the courthouse right now doing 
whatever it is you do to get hitched in a civil ceremony. I've got to run off 
and get ready for the reception now. Hopefully it won't be boring, or I'll have 
to make excuses and jet out of there.</P>
<P class=post>One more wedding tomorrow, then one day of work, then Colorado.

<H2>16 Jun 2003</H2>
<H3>Looks Like I'm Going To Colorado</H3>
<P>Somehow or another Robert managed to convince me to come with him (and his 
soon-to-be-wife Elizabeth) to Colorado on a ten-day hiking and climbing and 
backpacking and camping trip. I don't know how good and idea this really is, but 
I just spent $200 on gear. I'll also have to take almost 2 weeks off of work, 
which will cost me a lot more money. </P>
<P class=post>I don't know whether to be excited or pissed off at myself. </P>

<H3>Recompiling...</H3>
<P>I'm recompiling Diesel's kernel right now. Hopefully that will improve the 
performance of the machine some. I just found out that DMA wasn't on. If the new 
kernel still doesn't turn DMA on automatically I'll add the commands to do so to 
the startup scripts. This might just make Andy happy, and not hate Gentoo so 
much. </P>
<H4>20:38</H4>
<H3>Friday The 13th</H3>
<P>It's Friday the 13th, but I'm not scared.</P>
<P class=post>Sam and I looked at two bedroom places in Oakwood apartments 
today. I was quite impressed, and I really can't think of anything I saw that I 
didn't like. The living rooms were large and wide open, the bedrooms were of a 
decent size, there were decks, kitchens with dishwashers, closets, and other 
things. I have a feeling that we're going to take a room in this place, and all 
that we have to decide is whether to live on the ground level or the second 
level. I'd like to live on the terrace level because it has huge decks, but no 
suchk luck because it's all full already.</P>
<P class=post>I hope I can afford this, I've never had to pay for a place to 
live <EM>and</EM> go to school at the same time. </P>

<H3>I'm Getting There</H3>
<P>Slowly but surely I'm getting things lined up and worked out for fall. Maybe 
even by the end of the week I'll know where I'm going to live and have 
everything ready for getting into grad school. I sure hope everything works out 
the way I planned it to. </P>

<H3>Andy, Where Are You?</H3>
<P>I haven't seen <A href="http://andy.iowadvd.com/">Andy Buck</A> in quite a 
while. I haven't talked to him or even seen him online in days. <A 
href="http://www2.iastate.edu/~benjanke">Ben</A> said that he was on IRC for a 
while on Thursday, but I must have missed him. I called him twice on Thursday, 
but never got a response. I even tried stopping by his place with no luck. So 
where is he?</P>
<P class=post>He hasn't updated his main page in a while either, but I noticed 
that there are some new galleries put up that are dated June 6. I think that 
means that we can assume that Andy has <EM>not</EM> died, contrary to popular 
conjecture. My best guess is that he went off to Iowa City, but didn't tell 
anyone about it. He's probably been in a drunken stupor for the past three days 
or so. It would be just like him if that was true.</P>
<P class=post>We love you anyway, Andy. </P>

<H3>Scary Skies Over Ames</H3>
<P>There were some really cool clouds over Ames today around noon. The sky to

<H3>Rearrange Your Life</H3>
<P>The grand rearrangement project has begun in the basement. So far I've moved 
the small entertainment center from the west wall to the north, turned the futon 
around, and moved a bunch of my crap out of the main walking area. I have the 
receiver hooked up and running, and I've attached the Sony speakers, DVD player, 
and TV.</P>
<P class=post>One of the big things I did was move the Dell over to the 
entertainment center and hook it up to the receiver. With the help of X11 and 
X-Forwarding over SSH I use the PowerBook to control the Dell. Since the link 
between these two computers is through a wireless router, I can control what 
music is playing on the receiver from anywhere in the house. It works 
<EM>very</EM> well. Right now I use xmms to play the music, but my goal is to 
find a nice console based music jukebox and use that instead, so that I can open 
a screen session and run the jukebox in there. That would allow me to start up 
some music and detach the session with the music still playing. That appears to 
be impossible with xmms.</P>
<P class=post>I had a whole crap load of stuff that had no good storage options, 
so I went shopping for plastic storage with Sam. We found some nice Rubbermaid 
stuff at Lowe's, and i bought two large shallow containers, one large deeper 
container, and a media case. Now all my DVDs, video games, and random cables are 
pretty well organized and easy to move around. Hopefully that will get me 
started on controlling my insane overflow of random crap. I still have the 
deeper container to put stuff in, but the other three containers are completely 
full.</P>
<P class=post>I should just get rid of some of my crap. </P>

<H3>Golf</H3>
<P>Robert is back in town, and today seemed like the perfect day to inaugurate 
another season of bad golf play. We decided to play Homewood, like always, and 
headed out there around 1:00 PM. A word of caution to those who haven't been out 
there on a weekend yet this year: nine holes is now $14.50 on the weekend. 
That's really too much for a marginal 9-hole course, and I think I'm going to 
have to go out and find a nicer course that doesn't charge so much. I think 
there are some nice 18-hole courses around here that run about $20, which would 
be a much better deal. Anyway, today was a day for excellent tee shots and 
terrible approach shots. On almost ever hole I hit a long straight drive 
(usually with a 3-iron) that landed either near or on the fairway. I then 
proceeded to cock it up badly. For example on the sixth hole i landed 20 feet 
from the green on my first shot and hit it right over by about 30 yards.</P>
<P class=post>I usually don't even bother to hit my woods when I golf, since I 
tend to have a wicked slice that is only amplified by the low lofted clubs. I 
tried my 1-wood on the seventh hole anyway, and I drilled the ball well over 230 
yards, and straight to boot. That meant of course that I was off the fairway to 
the left, since I usually aim left to somewhat counteract the slice. Then I 
tried the 5-wood on #8 and hit it a good 200 yards, straight and high. Maybe I'm 
starting to gain some control over the drivers. It really doesn't matter though, 
because I can't putt to save my life.</P>
<P class=post>Ben, Ross, and anyone else who wants to go, lets set up a golf 
outing sometime soon. </P>

<H3>Summer...</H3>
<P>Well, two weeks of summer down, some more to go. My job is going OK like 
always, but I definitely need a change. The Next Big Thing I do will probably be 
to actually get enrolled at ISU again. I honestly didn't expect to be doing 
this, even a month ago. Life just comes as it does, I guess. </P>
<P class=post>In other work news, I now get to drive the tractors around. It's 
like people trust me or something. I can also drive the skid steer loader, and 
for stupid/ignorant people who don't know what that is (because you really do 
even if you don't recognize the name) <A 
href="http://www.newholland.com/nh/skidst.htm">here is a link</A>. The loader at 
work looks exactly like that (though we have several custom made attachments in 
addition to the standard bucket). So Liz, Sam, etc: that is a skid steer loader, 
and you <EM>have</EM> seen one before, because they hang around this town all 
the time. </P>

<H3>Wireless?</H3>
<P>I got a Linksys Wireless Router (802.11g) today. It's doing a fine job with 
the minimal tasks I have set so far, which is pretty much just networking the 
desktop Dell with the PowerBook without having to have the PB plugged into 
anything. I have Samba set up so I can access the files stored on the Dell from 
anywhere in the house, and everything works just fine. Now all I need is a 
decent internet connection so I don't have to go find a phone line any more.

<H3>BMW</H3>
<P>Andy let me take his BMW home with me last night. I drove it around for a 
good bit, and it is the fastest car I've ever driven. That really doesn't say 
much for the cars I've driven, I guess, but it sure was a lot of fun. Now I 
understand part of the reason he drives the way he does. The way that car 
accelerates and handles, and the way it always seems to have more power just 
waiting for you makes it almost impossible to not cock off in it. </P>
<P class=post>Now I <EM>really</EM> wish I had bought Alex's car. </P>

<H3>Wireless Is Handy</H3>
<P>I got pissed off at the internet at home, so I decided to come to campus and 
use the superior internet here instead. Right now I'm in 139 Durham, but it's a 
very pleasant night and i think I might head outside to enjoy it, while sitting 
on the interent. I know it seems silly, but it really is a nice night to sit 
outside and do some internet stuff, and that is where wireless comes in handy. 
Besides, I didn't feel like plugging in anyways. </P>

<H3>Xbench Freaked Me Out</H3>
<P>I ran Xbench on my PowerBook after I got terrible performance in the UT2003 
demo. It was almost unplayable, and I remembered some sluggishness earlier when 
I was using the machine. Then I ran Xbench and got an overall score of 53.41 and 
almost freaked. I wondered if my Al was somehow really slow. Then i remembered 
power management stuff, and it turns out that I have been running with the 
processor set to "Reduced Performance" for two days. I set that before I left to 
save battery life during the car ride to Missouri, but I really didn't need that 
setting enabled any more. I turned the processor back to full speed. and my 
scores jumped to 73.89, which is right in the middle of the average 12" 
PowerBook scores. My UT framerates shot way up as well. </P>
<P class=post>I guess the moral of the story is if your Mac laptop seems 
sluggish, check the power management settings before you freak out about having 
problems with the computer. </P>

<H3>The Weston Galleries Are Up</H3>
<P>I'm here at Sam's house using his internet connection to upload my files, so 
I have the photos from <A

<P class=post>Also, here is an edited photo of my little cousin Erica. Yes, I 
used a filter, but I also made extensive use of layers, levels, curves, and 
color balance tools as well, so I'm not totally lame.</P>

<H3>Angela Hoffman's Graduation, Weston Missouri</H3>
<P>This weekend was a 'big' family trip down to Weston to see Angie and the rest 
of the Hoffmans. Angie is graduating from West Platte High School today as a 
co-valedictorian. Of everyone who is probably reading this page, I think that 
only Sam has met her before. She showed us around Weston a bit when Sam and I 
came down to see Rush at the Sandstone ('Verizon Wireless') Amphitheater.</P>
<P class=post>Our trip started on a somewhat sad note. We first went down to Des 
Moines on Saturday morning to see my little sister Anne play a soccer game. The 
got beat pretty bad. Annie and my Dad stayed home because she had two more games 
to play this weekend. That meant that only four of us, the three 'big kids' and 
our mom, went to Weston. </P>
<P class=post>Weston was just as nice as I remembered it, a tiny little town 
with narrow streets and a lot of hills. People are friendly and there are a lot 
of neat old buildings, as well as a thriving downtown. It's really a very 
interesting town, with a lot of good photographic opportunities. I feel like I 
should stop there again on my next Missouri photographic trip. Actually I might 
take some of you along too. There's a bar there that Andy absolutely 
<EM>has</EM> to see. Maybe Sam would even feel like visiting again. He could get 
another espresso at the candy shop.</P>
<P class=post>We arrived around 3 P.M., about two hours before the official 
start of the graduation party. In typical fashion, things weren't ready by then. 
In atypical fasion, my cousin Greg and uncle Ron were in a rush to finish the 
new patio. At least I don't think most people are working to get brickwork done 
an hour before the guests are scheduled to arrive. Everything came together 
nicely though, and they got the white sand laid in between the bricks with ample 
time to spare.</P>
<P class=post>The party was pretty much your typical graduation party. i spend 
most of my time downstairs or on the patio with a beer or pop. I'm not really a 
fan of the crowded party thing where you don't know most of the people. I got to 
spend some nice time with my uncle Tom's children, especially Emily and Erica. 
Poor Emily is nine but has to follow the rules of a two year old because Erica 
follows her around everywhere. I got some nice photos of the both of them, which 
should all be in a new gallery I'll put up soon.</P>
<P class=post>My cousin Greg has purchased a lot in Weston and intends to build 
a new house there. He'll first probably have to tear down the old run-down shack 
that's there right now though. I'm sure that whatever he builds will be quite 
interesting. The front of the lot is a pretty good hill, while the back is more 
level and is set back in the trees. The back of his land juts up against a state 
park, so he should never have to worry about annoying neighbors there, either. 
Add all that to the fact that he is an architect, and i think we can expect a 
unique and original dwelling. Well, it had better be unique.</P>
<P class=post>The highlight of the night though was probably O'Malley's Pub in 
downtown Weston. From the outside it looks like a tiny little building, but the 
real pub is actually about three floors down in an old wine cellar. It is quite 
frankly amazing. I really wish I had brought my camera with me to that place. I 
know that a wine cellar three floors down in the middle of an old town sounds 
kind of like a dank and musty place but it is actually very nice. The walls and 
ceiling are of old stone, and the ceiling has a high arch to it. There are two 
levels in the bar itself, and every weekend they have live music. It's neat to 
find a place like that in a small town, especially since it's so well hidden 
away. Going there is like finding out a great little secret. Andy has to see it 
sometime.</P>
<P class=post>And the coolest part about the trip? I'm writing this now on my 
brand new 12 inch PowerBook G4, which I earlier used to import and edit the 
photos I took this weekend with my digital camera. I used the slideshow feature 
of iPhoto to show my pictures to my extended family, and everyone gathered 
around to see. I think that next time I do something like this I should carry 
the TV dongle with me so that I can run the side show on the television, tough. 
The PowerBook certainly didn't make me cooler, but it did allow me to do some 
very nice things on this trip. Now I think I'm going to plug in my Grados and 
listen to some music. With the sun shining the way it is I have the backlight 
down pretty much all the way and the 'Book estimates about four hours of life 
yet, so it should be able to get me home before it needs to be charged. I'm 
quite happy about this purchase. </P>

That is a stupid attitude. </P>

<H3>Feel The Power</H3>
<P>I have a 12" powerbook, and it is tiny, and gorgeous, and sexy, and silver, 
and everything is beautifully machined and assembled. there is a nice texture to 
the surface that makes it almost perfectly smooth but not quite. I'm quite 
excited about the whole thing. SO COOL! </P>

<P class=post>I ordered a Western Digital 120GB drive to put in the Dell 
('gaskill'). That ought to cure my chronic space problem at least for a little 
while.</P>
<P class=post>Also, I got the $2000 loan so that I can buy the powerbook. I'd be 
able to just purchase it oughtright by July, but I want it now, and this will 
help me build some credit. I plan to save all the money I'll need to pay back 
the loan so I don't have to worry even if I don't have a job by the end of the 
summer. </P>

<H3>I'm Going Back To KDE</H3>

come back to it. I spent most of my time away in <A 
href="http://www.windowmaker.org/">Window Maker</A> and the programmers for that 
project deserve some credit, becuase it's a very nice system. Still, I was using 
a conglomeration of apps that never quite fit together. Now that I'm back using 
KDE i realized how much I really like Konqueror, KMail, KEdit, etc. The only 
program I used a lot that I really like better than the KDE version is <A 
href="http://aterm.sourceforge.net/">aterm</A>, and I've solved that problem by 
changing my old Konsole keyboard shortcut to launch aterm instead. </P>

<P>I was looking through my photo albums, which I recently updated and sorted 
out, and I think that I really like the look of color film. I think that I need 
to start shooting on film again. If I had a light meter I might give slides a 
try, but I don't. What I really need is a camera with smooth action and a good 
metering system. <A href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/srt100.jpg">My 
Minolta</A> unfortunately does not have either. I might have to see if my dad 
will let me borrow his Olympus OM-1 again. Otherwise I'll just have to get an

from the UP today. Of course we don't have the proper keyboard to use

like I want is to either use a different content management system that was more 
flexible, rewrite the current one, or use cheap hacks and broken code to try to 
fix it. The first option would be a hassle, and the second would require 
knowledge of perl. The last would just be worthless.</P>
<P class=post>This should work just fine for now, though. </P>

<H3>A New Look For KDE</H3>
<P>I tossed my KDE appearance settings around last night to make them smoother 
and slicker. It's pretty flat now, but it looks nice and is easy on the eyes. I 
pretty much made everything smaller (fonts, icons, window borders). I think I 
like this, and now my IRC windows take up 1/3 of the screen instead of 2/3. </P>

<P>The University sent me an email yesterday about financial aid, so I went to 
AccessPlus and checked on it, and now I'm apparently eligable for a couple loans 
(like the Stafford Loan). This is the first time that's ever happened. It's very 
strange, and I have school already paid for, and it's the middle of the 
semester. </P>

<H3>There Ought To Be A Test</H3>
<P>Before people are allowed to use computers, or, god forbid, the internet, 
they should have to pass an intelligence test. You should be able to spell, use 
punctuation properly, and maybe even be able to score a D in grammar. A 
requirement to read documentation before asking stupid questions would be good 
as well. I'm tired of idiots on message boards asking questions that have been 
answered well in the documentation. I'm tired of people complaining when things 
don't work only to find out that they haven't even looked at the instructions on 
how to do it. I'm tired of people who don't bother to take a minute to look 
something up before wasting other people's time. Essentially, I'm tired of 
people like this: </P>

to the last chapter of the story. Now I've done the whole game, including all 
the side quests that cryptic guy at the end of time was talking about. I have 
now finished Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, but it's too bad that I did them

<H3>Kansas City Photos Are Up</H3>
<P>All the pictures I took with the digital camera are now up in a <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/o2.php?/photos/pg0016">new gallery</A>. Some of 
the photos are pretty cool, but most are pretty much just touristy snapshots. 
Hopefully I got some good shots with my <A 
href="http://www.steveblock.com/images/srt100.jpg">Minolta SLR</A>. I haven't 
used it in a long time. </P>
<P>The man who showed us around KC yesterday is Alex Leigh. He's a really nice 
guy and a heck of a photographer. Thanks Alex for being so generous. You should 
all check out <A href="http://www.tessier.com/">his site</A> and his photo 
galleries, because he's a better photographer than I am. </P>

<H3>Kansas City Rules!</H3>
<P>We are in our second day in KC, and having a hell of a time. We're at this 
guy named Alex's place, who we only met in person for the first time today. He 
is very cool, and much like Andy he is a mac guy with a crapload of electronics. 
He showed us around downtown this afternoon. It's been a pretty sweet trip 
overall. </P>
<P>The weather out here is absolutely amazing. It's about 77 degrees and sunny. 
The best part is all the "spring break" type places like California and Florida 
are rainy and snowy right now. The best weather in the entire US is in the 
midwest! </P>

<H3>I Like the BeOS</H3>
<P>I know it's dead, but the BeOS is still one of the greatest operating systems 
ever made. In most areas its usability still far exceeds that of Linux, even 
though Linux is still in active development by hundreds of people.</P>
<P>I wiped my Redhat partition yesterday and put the BeOS R5 in its place. I 
like it better than Redhat already. I can't decide if I should keep using BeOS 
or switch back to Linux. I guess I have a choice since both the BeOS and Linux 
are still installed. </P>

<H3>Holy Hell I'm Done</H3>
<P>I finished my 415 project. I finished it. I finished it on time. Holy shit 
this is weird, because now I'm not working on it. I feel like i just handed 
Gassman my ass, but it doesn't matter anymore because it's out of my hands. I 
spent 14 hours over the past two days on this shit, and over 60 hours total and 
I still think it's pretty crappy in places. </P>
<P>But who cares? </P>
<P>IT'S DONE DAMMIT. </P>
<H4>16:10</H4>
<H2>05 Mar 2003</H2>
<H3>This is a Crappy Week</H3>
<P>But after tomorrow I'll be done with IE 408 (other than the last take home 
test). Somehow I might even manage to get my Solidworks done so that I can turn 
in my 415 project, but I'm not so sure about that. Even so I don't think I'm 
going to worry too much. I'll just try to get it done. </P>
<P>In other news, I don't think I've updated on the printer situation in a 
while. On a whim on Sunday afternoon I pulled open the Memory Expansion slot on 
the side of the Laserjet III (the one that works). Lo and behold there was a 
memory expansion card, which should have meant that I had enough memory to 
properly print in Linux. I pulled it out and blew it off, then plugged it back 
in and made sure it was firmly seated. Then I turned the printer back on and 
watched it pass a self test. A subsequent test print proved that the the RAM was 
now properly installed and working. I can now print perfectly, and the only 
problem I get is some feed issues that I think are caused by the incredibly dry 
air in this room. </P>
<P>Let me tell you, a working laser printer, even a 300 DPI one, kicks the shit 
out of any inkjet when printing black and white documents (95% of what I print). 
What's even cooler is that I got this whole thing set up for $23, which is about 
$5 less than it would have cost for me to just replace my empty black ink 
cartridge. </P>

<P><A href="http://www.steveblock.com/Storm.mp3">This is a great song</A>, and I 
can't wait until it's mastered and released so i can buy it (straight from 
Canada). I think it's the first time Devin Townsend has mentioned his wife Tracy 
by name in a song.</P>
<P>The best part is that he doesn't use any of that damn computar correction on 
his voice, so all the flaws that make it so human are there. Somehow it sounds 
better when it's not perfect.</P>
<P>By the way, these lyrics are based on what I can hear when I listen to the 
song, so no guarantees that it's perfectly correct. <BR><BR><EM><STRONG>Devin

<H3>Unix Is Great</H3>
<P>After an unsuccessful attempt to find a Linux distribution better than <A 
href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</A> I decided it was time to just give up 
and install Gentoo again. The problem with this idea was that I had (still have, 
actually) homework to get done and I needed a working Operating System to do it. 
I solved this little dilemma by using <A 
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">Knoppix</A>: a bootable 
Linux CD that autodetects hardware and loads up a fully functional <A 
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>-based Linux system with a whole 
crapload of programs ready to run. It doesn't even need a hard drive to work. 
</P>
<P>So with Knoppix I got a working Linux system running <A 
href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 3 that I could use to get my work done, AND 
install Gentoo in a little terminal window on the corner of the desktop AT THE 
SAME TIME! Computer things just don't get very much cooler than that. </P>
<H4>01:08</H4>
<H3>A Printer UPdate</H3>
<P>Quite a bit has happened with the laser printer situation since my last 
printers post. Since then I have combined the two nonworking fusers into one 
perfectly functional fuser. I still had some streaking problems, but I figured 
those out as well. I bought a Laserjet II at the UP sale on Wednesday. It had a 
toner cartridge and many functional parts, but otherwise was nothing special. I 
put that toner into the Laserjet III and lo and behold it worked perfectly. So 
as of this moment I have one very functional HP Laserjet III, one mostly 
functional Laserjet II, and a nonfunctional Newgen TurboPS/630.</P>
<P>My new printer project is to get the Newgen working because, unlike the two 
HPs, the Newgen does PostScript. I pulled the fuser out of the "new" Laserjet II 
and shoved it into the Newgen, but the printer won't feed paper properly. Paper 
only gets a couple inches in before it stops moving. The problem appears to be a 
worn pickup roller, so I'm going to TRY to swap it out with the roller from the 
Laserjet II as well. I have a working printer, but it's nothing special. If I 
could have a working PostScript printer, however, it would kick ass, since (at 
least in Linux) PostScript is much better supported. </P>
<H4>01:06</H4>
<H2>23 Feb 2003</H2>
<H3>I Don't Like Printers</H3>
<P>The first printer I bought didn't work because of grinding gears. I bought 
another one last week and it worked but it printed with a lot of streaks and 
ghosting and other crap. I was attempting to clean it up when i noticed that the 
fuser had a big tear it in. That explained why I was getting poor fusing. I 
swapped one of the fuser gears over to the fuser from the other printer I bought 
and installed that one, but there were still grinding noises (though different 
from before) and the printer therefore still didn't work. I then started pulling 
the fuser apart to see if I could swap the rollers. It might be possible, but it 
will take a long time, as there are a <EM>lot</EM> of screws and i'm pissed off 
anyways.</P>
<P>Anyhow, here's a nice picture of the printer and fuser in their current state 
of glory.</P>

<H3>Somehow I Make It Every Time</H3>
<P>Last night I pretty much had no hope that I could get my assignments for 
today done on time. I spent four hours in the computer lab last night getting 
next to nothing done, and then two more hours at home working on a different 
assignment. Somehow I got second assignment done and I already turned it in. The 
first assignment is a large progress report for my design class. I don't know 
what I'm doing in that class, but somehow I managed to make a progress report 
that is actually not half bad. I'm not even quite sure how I did it. I don't 
think the numbers are quite right but that's OK because I got it mostly done. 
I'll have some time in class today to finish it up and print it out. </P>

<H3>Guess What</H3>
<P>I'm going back to Gentoo. I'll figure my damn memory problems out on my own. 
Even Debian feels fucked up to me. Portage is the greatest collection of scripts 
and programs EVER. I mean it. I've never found anything quite so cool. </P>

<H3>Most Linux Distros Are Bullshit</H3>
<P>I was having major memory leak issues with my Gentoo system, so I thought it 
might be a good time to try something new. I have now tried Redhat 8, Slackware 
8.1, and VectorLinux 3.2. In the past I've used just about every other distro as 
well. So far they all suck for one very important reason: they don't deal with 
dependencies. Slackware feels out of date, Redhat is too newbie oriented, and 
VectorLinux can install programs automatically but forgets to get the proper 
program dependencies. I'm fed up with the whole deal. Tonight I think I'm going 
to try to install Debian (I've never done that successfully). If I can't get 
that working I'm going back to Gentoo. I guess that most distribution people 
think that making the system "newbie friendly" or getting a great system 
installer is more important than having a great update and software installation 
system. </P>

your asses in gear or something. Hoo yeah. </P>

<H3>Oh Man the 12" Powerbook is Cool</H3>
<P>I went to the <A href="http://www.mpc.iastate.edu/">MPC</A> today to demo the 
powerbook that I want so very much. It is a very impressive little piece of 
hardware. In fact the only hardware cooler than it was the tablet PCs, but they 
all run Windows. I want OSX! Somehow I have to get the money to get that thing. 
Should I really take out a loan? </P>

<P>The new domain is up and running, folks! This is exciting. Now when I tell 
people about my web page it'll be super easy. If all you guys who link to me 
don't mind, could you update your links to point to http://www.steveblock.com 
instead of either my public locker or http://steve.nofw.org? That would be 
awesome and killer and everything else. </P>

<H3>Gnome 2.2 Is Nice</H3>
<P>Gnome 2.2 finally came out, and it's actually quite nice. A lot of big 
applications have yet to be ported to GTK2, but I've got my fingers crossed that 
that will happen soon. Gnome 2.2 feels quite a bit more complete than Gnome 2.0 
did, but I still feel that the preferences section leaves something to be 
desired. There's just not quite enough customizability. Still, I like it a lot, 
and I plan to use it for a while so that I can make a fair comparison with KDE 
3.1. </P>
<P>I took a screenshot of my current desktop running Gnome 2.2. Sam might notice 
that I've replaced an older version of Gaim with a prerelease CVS version 
(0.60cvs) of Gaim that uses GTK2 instead of the older GTK. It actually supports 
font faces and antialiased text now, and it just plain looks prettier 
overall.</P>

<H3>Super Fun With NFS</H3>
<P>I figured out some more NFS related stuff, and now my website files are 
accessable to my main computer via NFS. This will hopefully be a little bit 
easier than using SSH to log in and edit files when I want to make a new post. 
Of course, I plan to keep using SSH so that I can post updates from almost any 
computer with internet access. </P>

<H3>Lesser Known Saint Rocked</H3>
<P>You guys who didn't go missed out. The first band that played (narcotic- 
something or other) was a boring crappy garage band thing. They had maybe ten 
fans, if that. When LKS came on stage the number of people watching shot way up. 
On top of that LKS was tight, and their new song is cool. </P>

<H3>More RSS Info</H3>

up, I have a couple small screenshots of the settings and the feed. I hope they 
help out.<BR>

<H3>Blosxom Does RSS (And So Can You)</H3>
<P>I just found out that the same Blosxom script that runs this entire website 
also handles output in the form of an RSS feed. Feeds of this protocol are used 
to check a site, grab the headlines, and make links to the actual posts or 
articles that the headlines relate to. Although I'm not sure how much use this 
really is, anyone using Ximian Evolution, for example, can try it out. If you 
want to, just go to your Evolution settings and open the Summary Preferences 
window. Under the News Feeds tab hit the 'Add news feed' button and put <FONT 
color=red>http://steve.nofw.org/?flav=rss</FONT> in the URL box. Go ahead and 
name it whatever you like. If you then add the new feed to your Summary page you 
can see the titles of all my posts! </P>

<H3>Today I Ran a Mile</H3>
<P>That might not sound like much, but instead of going to the used possession 
sale like I might have (sorry boys) I went running with Travis instead. I ran my 
first real honest to god unadulterated mile in five or six years. I didn't slow 
down, I didn't stop, I didn't walk, I just kept running. I could even have gone 
a few more laps. I honestly could hardly believe it.</P>
<P>I'm going to get a new band for my digital watch and time myself next time.

<H3>X-Forwarding Over SSH Is Grrrrreat.</H3>
<P>I love how I can run any program that is on my home machine on any computer 
with an X server and an SSH client. For Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOSX these things 
are either included with various releases or easily obtained for free. In 
Windows, X servers can be bought or obtained freely, depending on the level of 
sophistication needed. SSH clients like PuTTY are readily available for free. No 
matter how you slice it, it is possible for me to run KMail or Konqueror or 
XChat or anything else as long as I have a network connection.</P>
<P>The best performace has to be with a *nix machine running XFree86 on a good 
LAN connection. Right now I am in the Black Engineering computer lab on a Redhat 
7.3 machine and I am running several of my KDE apps on this machine. I honestly 
can't tell by look or feel that these programs are not local. This is just plain 
amazing.</P>
<P>I'm sure Andy will enjoy this when he's running stuff off of his new AMD 
FreeBSD 5.0 machine on his Quicksilver. </P>

<H3>KDE 3.1 Is Out!</H3>
<P>At least, on the 3.1 page they have 3.1 binaries, there was a post on 
OSNews.com, and portage says 3.1 is available and unmasked. I started compiling 
it and some of its dependencies around 8:00, so I should have it done probably 
by Wednesday afternoon. Sometimes I wonder why I go with this source-based 
distro instead of RedHat or something. But then I think of how well I understand 
this system and how I managed to avoid all the crap that I was forced to deal 
with otherwise.</P>
<P>I still wish I could have it right now, even though it's probably not that 
big of an update. </P>

<H3>The Terrible Mr. Grimshaw</H3>

couple of my friends when they played Counterstrike. </P>
<H4>22:27</H4>
<H3>I Feel Like Crap</H3>
<P>I am getting a nasty cold now. I felt crappy all day, so I went to bed not 
long after I got home, and I woke up around 7. The problem is that now I'm not 
really sure what day it feels like. It's hard to fathom that 12 hours ago I was 
in class, when it feels like days have passed.</P>
<P>I got ME 490 added, so I can now drop IE 361. I need to go do that soon, 
since I really don't want to keep taking it, and I haven't gone to it since last 
Wednesday anyway.</P>
<P>I am not a good dancer. I was under the influence of wine and whiskey at the 
time. Andy just happened to have several devices with witch to record me making 
a fool of myself. </P>

<H3>I Need to Get Out of Windows!</H3>
<P>I'm at work, trying to use Photoshop to edit some photographs that appear to 
have been lost before they made it to the proper image directory. I need to open 
them, check the embedded file information, change anything that's necessary, 
rotate or crop them as necessary and save them back to the network. 
Unfortunately, our server runs Windows, and my computer runs Windows, and I just 
need to get out. I need a *nix machine fast. A MacOS X machine would be best, 
but at this point I'll take my computer and the Gimp. Photoshop is completely 
dead, explorer just crashed, I can barely move around the network, and the hard 
drive is thrashing like crazy. </P>

<H3>Nimda is Funny</H3>
<P>It might not be funny if you're a Windows user and you don't have decent 
antivirus protection, or if you run an IIS server and haven't patched it yet, 
but seeing the characteristic exploits used by nimda in your Apache server log 
on your FreeBSD server is kind of funny. </P>
<P>I can't laugh too loudly though, since new security exploits are being found 
all the time. Also, I remember last summer when I set up a Windows 2000 based 
router that I mistakenly allowed IIS to install itself on. I had nimda in less 
than 12 hours. I think now and in the future my servers will stick to safer 
software than IIS. </P>

<H3>Jesus Lives!</H3>
<P>That's right folks. Jesus is up and running FreeBSD, serving NFS, and pretty 
much kicking some major ass. Andy and I are doing admin stuff, and we're going 
to try to get Jesus' 17 gig drive shared over NFS on himac. I've had to get Andy 
to stop raping Jesus a few times, but overall he's taking our abuse very well. 
If any of you want an account on Jesus, like if you want to learn about unix or 
BSD or you just like having accounts, just email me or message me or 
something.</P>
<P>Yes, Jesus truly is a god.</P>
<P>We may start serving web pages off of Jesus soon, but that's kind of up to 
Andy, since between us we would then have three web servers. We'll see. </P>

<H2>17 Jan 2003</H2>
<H3>What Kind of Crap is This?</H3>
<P>Andy's internal network adapter died. Then he bought a NIC and it didn't 
work. Then he took the NIC from his old PC, which I have right now. It didn't 
work either. Then he bought a "Mac OS 10.2 compatible" PCI network card. That 
doesn't work either. To top it all off, the drive he ordered from the CD-R/RW 
section of a web site turned out not to be a CD-R or CD-RW, but an ordinary 
CD-ROM. The poor guy has nothing but trouble with his ultra-powerful machine. It 
sucks ass. </P>
<H4>18:45</H4>
<H3>Poor Noodle</H3>
<P>One of Sam's Noodles died. That is very sad, and I wish it hadn't happened.

<H3>School Started Again... And It Still Sucks</H3>
<P>That's right. I started class again bright and early at 8:00 this morning. My 
first professor seems like an alright guy, but he is quite boring. The class is 
about solving differential equations using the finite element method, and no, 
that does not mean using something nice and pretty like CosmosWorks but instead 
something wholly evil, like MATLAB. Uck.</P>
<P>I'm still trying to set up a 490 with Dr. Pate so that I can drop this dumb 
Quality Control class that I signed up for so that I could get my scholarship 
money. I can't wait to graduate and get out of here. I'm just about burned out 
on classwork. </P>
<H4>09:42</H4>
<H3>New Photo Gallery</H3>
<P>Thanks to Andy, I now have a picture gallery set up on himac. It's very cool. 
As soon as I figure out how to get Gallery Remote working on my machine (it 
complains about some missing libraries that aren't missing at all) I'll put a 
bunch more pictures up. Right now I have the original gallery that Andy set up 
and some pictures from my trip to Colorado. I'm also working on a new cam pic, 
so soon you will see it up on Sam and Lisa's cam pages. </P>

<H3>I'm Running Out of Time</H3>
<P>It's Thursday. I have to pretty much make sure all my things are in order by 
tomorrow so that we can go skiing. Unfortunatley I feel like I have a million or 
so things to do before then, and when we get back it's time for school to start 
again. I really wish this ski trip was time more like RAGBRAI. That trip was in 
the middle of summer, so I had ample time both before and after the trip to 
enjoy myself. Now I'm just worried about finding a class for next semester, 
making sure I have enough money for this trip and to finish school, etc. I'm not 
so certain that I really can have much fun now. Besides that, I don't really 
have "proper" ski equipment. I don't know how much money is too much to spend or 
what is really necessary anyway. If only there was another week of break, so 
that I felt like I could come back and relax a bit before starting school up 
again. </P>
