The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Eighteen

</PRE><A NAME="Day26"><PRE>
DAY TWENTY SIX - Almost Furthest North

Bright warm sunshine; clear blue sky except for a bit of haze around the
edges.  Coroskeir is moored up on the Walthamstow Marshes with 13 miles
or so to go before reaching the junction with the River Stort, and only
27 miles to go before reaching her final destination in Bishops
Stortford.  On board are Andy and Julian, raring to go.

The first part of the log is written in Andy's scrawl, so I am tempted
to think he pulled the early morning setting off trick on Julian
again...  A pretty typical beginning to the day.

0744  Set off under electric motor
0745  Stop to clear weed from around the propellor
0749  Continue

0845  Tottenham Lock.  Two parallel locks key operated on the right and
windlass operated on the left.  Coroskier enters the windlass operated
lock.  Not only is it full of water which is a nuisance, (we're heading
up now, so this has to be emptied out before we can enter) but the top
gates are open.  The electric bit isn't working so Julian has to use the
windlass to close the gates, as well as to open the paddles.

The electric bit is to take the hard work out of doing locks.  Just
press a button and the gates close, paddles open... oh if only those on
the Nene could have seen this, no more horrid spinny wheels that do
nothing!

0917  Exit, having also pumped out the prop shaft sump which was
overflowing with water, grease and muck.  Lovely!  The prop shaft lefts
in just a little bit of water, despite being greased every day.  This
combines with the general yuck of the engine room, bits of vegetation
that fall into the boat through the aft hatch, pens and miscellaneous
oddments that drop from the engine room shelves onto the floor and the
occasional splash of diesel from filling up the genny.  This bitter
cocktail ends up in a small space under the floor behind the engine room
steps and is generally forgotten about, though it should be regularly
checked and emptied.

0930  Attempt nifty manoevure by cruising close to the left hand bank so
that Andy can leap ashore, but get the bow stuck in the shallows
instead.  It is very shallow.  Lots of pushing with the trusty pole and
rocking the boat sideways while putting the egg whisk full astern (Hah!)
 Eventually Cori is free but Julian is a little embarressed as he could
see it was shallow.  He adomishes himself by writing in the logbook how
he will go more slowly next time.

0945  Stowbridge Lock.  All a bit high tech, Coroskeir enters the
electric side of the pair of locks and Andy oversees the procedure from
the central control panal.  The sluice water comes in evenly along the
locks length making it all very smooth.
0955  Exit.  Andy cycles off to buy provisions.
1005  Shirt off, shorts and suncream on.
1015  "As I recline on the roof in just shorts, one of a bunch of
workmen in an ajacent yard calls out something like "Take everything off
mate!  Go on!" - Lucky Julian, always a hit with the locals.

1050  Andy returns appearing on the towpath with bags of shopping
dangling off the handlebars and cycles on to prepare the next lock.
1108  Pickett's Lock, famed for its ice rink and radio rallies.  As the
paddle is opened the water gushes in unexpectedly throwing Cori in all
directions.  Within the cabin, two oil lamp glasses fall to the floor,
one of them smashed.  Drat!
1120  Exit

1140  Andy provides sausage and mushroom sandwiches with lettuce and
mayo, and then leaps ashore with his to run on to the next lock.
1155  Ponders End Locks.  Use the electric one which has particularly
squeaky gates.
1203  Exit
1225  Refill the generator
1230  A lone cyclist appears ahead on the towpath.  It's Julian's
brother Jay, coming to partake in the penultimate day of narrowboating
adventures.
1240  Drop Andy off to prepare the next lock... but where's the key?

In fact, where is the bunch of keys with all of the important ones on?

Drat, must have left them at the last lock now two miles behind!  Andy's
trusted steed is passed ashore and he sets off to get them.
1300  Enfield Lock.  Andy returns with the keys which is lucky as this
is part manual, part electric.
1320  Generator off so that Jay can experience the peace of the
waterways.  Exit lock.
13??  Romney Marsh Lock and sandwiches on the roof.  How civilised.
1353  Exit

1415  Waltham Town Lock.  "A flock of school children cross the lock
gates as we enter on a river dipping trip"
1429  Exit.  the children are crossing back shouting the usual "How much
is one of them mister?" and "I want one!"
1436  As Coroskeir sedately cruises through clouds of geese and ducks
she is filmed by an enthusiastic tourist.
1537  Exit Cheshunt Lock, manfully controlled by Jay.
1600  Aqueduct Lock
1606  Exit.  there is a little bit of an aquaduct ahead.

1853  (In Andyscrit)  "Oops, haven't logged anything for a while. 
Turned onto Stort 20 minutes ago.  Narrow,windy, wooded, pretty. 
Narrower locks than on the Lee.  Passed through (???? lemur?) Lock 5
minutes ago"  I think Andy is refering to Brick Lock, reached before you
get to Roydon.
1930  Pick up Shona walking along the towpath, joining for the final
day.
2015  Exit Roydon Lock having picked up those Stalwarts of the Nene,
Francoise, Peter, Ben, Helena and Katie Wynn, also determind to be in on
the last moments of the adventure.
2040  Stop by Hunsdon Mill Lock.  Francoise cycles to fetch their car;
the rest of us eat lots of pasta and meat and veg that Andy has cooked
up, helped by Shona.  Francoise returns, a bit muddy from cycling
through a puddle just before loading the bike into the car and
deservedly eats too.

After a final evening of watery merriment, the Wynns head home, Peter
and Helena primed to join us for the final push tomorrow.  Julian, Jay,
Andy and Shona settle down for the final night afloat and on the move. 
Back in Stortford I hop up and down with excitement, off to join them in
the morning having not really had my mind on work for the day.

DAY TWENTY SEVEN - A glorious homecoming and a last little accident

0750  Julian awakes and dresses and leaps ashore to empty the lock.  
Last day!  Last day!
0800  Andy joins him, preparing the boat for the off
0810  Jay joins in
0830  Parndon Lock
0900  Catherine is spotted on the left hand bank...

I had awoken extremely early and got the train down to Harlow, but
didn't really know which side of Harlow Cori was.  At first I gave them
the benefit of the doubt, walking North towards Stortford along the
river parkside and spotting a kestral, but there was no sign of them, so
I turned round and headed south back towards Roydon beneath the cool of
a blackthorn thicket.  Not long before I see Cori's proud, if slightly
scarred, black and green prow with her faded knotwork slowly working its
way down the river toward me.  Jay is on the roof, a relaxed smile on
his face.  Julian is at the helm.

...but it is too shallow for us to come alongside so she has to turn
back until there is a bridge from which she can jump down onto the roof.

Home at last.

Shona cooks a very welcome breakfast of bacon, sausages, eggs tomatoes
and beans, and we all feast on the roof whilst going through Burnt Mill
Lock by Harlow Station.

Harlow is not the most attractive of places, but today, when viewed from
the roof of the narrowboat with the sun sparkling on the water and
crowds of moorhen ambivalently parting before us, it could be paradise. 
The sky is cool blue, making the willow trees almost glow in the morning
light.  I watch out for my kestral, but he's gone.

1000  Shona takes the helm for the first time ever on a narrowboat, and,
after a whole twenty seconds of instruction and experience from
Catherine drives through a tree on the opposite bank which takes Andy's
green fairy liquid mug (another story) over the edge of the roof and
lost to the depths of the Stort.  Oh well.  Much more fun to go
ploughing through willow trees than to try and stay out of them...

1020  Latton Lock.  Here a pair of rather dumpy middle aged men make
polite conversation while carrying their canoe over the lock.  They're
returning to Harlow.
1100  A approaching boat on the wrong side of the river is firmly
shunted into the bank by us.  That'll teach him to drive on the wrong
side!  Bit mean of us perhaps.
1107  Julian removes his shirt in order to enjoy the sunshine, seeing as
he;s had a check and there are no workmen about. 
Andy attempts to make a heroic leap to shore.  However, he misses and
crashes
into an ash tree instead, cutting his hand.
1129  Harlow Mill Lock, a particularly deep one.
1135  On we go, Andy wearing Shona's pink top on his head in an attempt
to block out the sun.

1150  Jay is complaining about his head being too hot because of the
amount of hair.  "Right." says Andy and disappears below decks to return
with the clippers on a long extention lead.  In minutes the roof is
covered in fluffy bits of Jays hair, and shortly after Andy's mingles
with it.  It gets everywhere!  Not to be left out, Julian decides to
join in the great clipping exhibition, despite having never had his hair
done with clippers before.  Not before too long we have three clones up
on
deck, Julian nervously brushing his hand across his head, slightly
startled at what he has done...

1215  Freakes Lock (How appropriate)
1220  Exit, desperately trying to get the worst of the hair off the roof
and into the water.
1225  Andy leaps ashore to prepare the next lock, no accidents this time
as he jumps up onto a bridge rather than sideways onto the land.
1240  Tie up at Sheering Mill Lock awaiting 'Mary Jane' of Little
Hallingbury to exit.  How lovely it is to see boats with local names
instead of being from all round the Wrekin.  The train journey out to
Cori this morning only took me twenty minutes, we're so nearly there!

It's a funny feeling though, to be so near something awaited for so
long.  Every moment of my life for a month has been eaten up with the
boat.  Worrying about where she is, whose on her, how I'm going to get
out there, how anyone else is going to get out there... completely
consuming.  The excitement of waking up everyday in a new place.  The
moods of the river, the changing habitats and landscapes, the people,
the places.  What will it be like to be at rest?  How will I handle
being at peace?

1250  In the lock with windlass uppers and electric lowers.
1300  Out of the lock, Shona and Julian taking to the canoe, Catherine
ashore hunting for Helena and Peter.  We meet on the towpath, Peter
carrying a big bag and Helena a huge grin.  "We're carrying something
special," Helena smiles. "We're carrying something for arriving.  I'm
not allowed to tell you about the Sam Paign, but we've got some."  We
make a rather ungainly scrabble across the enormous moored up 'Emily'
under a willow in order to get back onto Cori.  Peter manages not to
throw the Champagne in the water.
"Don't drop the Champagne!" shouts Helena.  "IT'S A SECRET SURPRISE!!!"

1310  Coroskeir enters Sawbridgeworth Lock.  
1320  The sun is absolutely belting down and Helena is determind to get
into the canoe from the narrowboat.  I am already in the canoe and reach
out my arms to her at the hatch, a little worried she will tumble and
fall into the water.

SPLOSH

Time stands still.
"What was that?  squawks Helena from the hatch.  "Can I get into the
canoe?"

I am staring down into the water.  My camera!  That must have been my...
...Oh.
Bugger.
It was my phone.

All of us have mobiles these days, all of us apart from Steve who is
faithfully compiling all of these stories on his webpage, and Adrian and
Lucy because they've put up so much resistance to go back now would be
wrong.  My phone is my lifeline.  Without a computer at my fingertips
whenever I need it there are an awful lot of people I would lose without
that little piece of technology to find them again.  On it are the
numbers and messages from so many of my friends.  So many numbers
entered in haste at partings of people I will now never be able to
contact again.  So many people lost in that sudden moment.

I watch the phone sink out of reach, momentarily stunned.

At least it wasn't my camera.
Little solace there.
I get the sea-search magnet a vainly trawl the depths.  
There is nothing at the bottom.  Mobile phones are not magnetic.
Peter rings it.  My answerphone replies.

Now, if this had happened earlier in the trip it would have been a total
and unmitigated disaster.  Totally.  Without my phone all of the
co-ordination required to move a 58 ft narrowboat 220 miles could not
have happened and the stress levels would have been off any kind of
measurable scale.  For years I said I Would Not have one, but now,
without it, I am suddenly bereft.

"Pleeeeeeease can I get into the canoe?" squeaks Helena.

1327  Exit the lock, Julian, Shona and myself in the canoe.  I am in
shock.  I cannot believe I have just thrown my phone into the depths.

My canoing isn't very good.  The three of us spend most of our time
laughing and getting wet and crashing into the banks of the river as we
speed towards Tednambery Lock which we open for Cori.

Helena and Julian join me and peter in the canoe and we head on
upstream, ahead of Cori, to open Spellbrook Lock.  We get a bit diverted
however, by a cut on the left and go to explore it, ending up all lying
down in the bottom of the canoe in order to get under the lowest bridge
in the world.  (Well, it probably isn't, but our noses are almost
scraping the ceiling).  When we return Andy shouts at us as the lock
needs to be drained first (which we haven't done yet) and there's
another boat now behind us.  Oops.

1450  Enter Spellbrook Lock
1455  Exit
1530  Arrive, after many twists and turns and waves at trains (the
Stortford / London line, how often I have travelled it on my way to the
boat in the depths of the country and wondered what it would be like to
finally be on the the Stort) at Twyford Lock.  The last lock before
home.
1550 Exit, me at the helm and snakes in my stomach.

From Twyford lock, the River Stort bends sinuously through comfrey
covered banks, the steep sides of Brooms Plantation and the Essex
Wildlife Trust's Rushy Meads nature reserve to starboard, and houses and
nasty conifers to port.  It doesn't seem real.

1610  Have to revert to the genny as the batteries are almost completely
dead.
1611  Final prop check, anything to put off motoring forwards.

And then suddenly, we come around the bend, and ahead is the Island.

When, a long long time ago, Stortford was a prosperous and happy place
famous for it's malting industry, the River Stort was canalised so that
people could get boats up and down it without runnng aground all the
time.  The original course of the river still remains and flows down the
side of the lock under a big weir.  The original river therefore creates
a small island, known to the locals as 'April Island' which is a small
piece of heaven to those who live there.

The first thing that catches your eye is the little white house, the
lockkeeper's cottage, that presides over the river.  A massive
conservatory sparkles in the afternoon sun, and a large dutch barge sits
comfortably at it's moorings alongside a well tended garden.  On the far
bank I notice the most fabulous pollarded oak tree.
There are more boats moored up at the end of the garden, and these curve
round and
follow the cut, made by the old river, towards the weir.  The cut is
dreadful wiggly.  

It's dreadfully shallow where the cut and river meet.
Andy reverses up it as if he's been doing it all his
life.  I have a feeling it won't be so easy for me!

Dudley, the owner of the island, directs us to moor up alongside
'Veronica Jay',
promising that before too long there will be space elsewhere on the
island and I will have my own mooring.  Veronica Jay is moored up
underneath a vast willow tree, whose tender branches we pass beneath
before mooring up.  The far bank is a mass of hawthorn and blackthorn,
the island displays a beautiful open area dominated by an immense apple
tree in full, glorious flower.  
There is a huge vegetable patch and compost heap.
The birds are singing.  
The genny is silenced.  
We have finally arrived.



I cry.  

I don't think my brain really knows what else to do.  It's over.
All the stress, the worry, the wonder.
Now a new life aboard.  A new life in my first solo home, afloat.  
Peter opens the champagne.

******************************

And so it ends. 
Or perhaps not, perhaps that was, after all, the beginning.

I can only think of the end of C.S Lewis' The Last Battle...

' Then Aslan turned to them and said:
"You do not yet look so happy as I mean you to be."

Their hearts leaped and a wild hope rose within them.

And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say
that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the
beginning of the real story... in which every chapter is better than the
one before. '

</PRE><A NAME="Epilogue"><PRE>
***

I have been living on Coroskeir for almost 6 months and April Island is
my own little piece of heaven.  I have made some truly superb and most
excellent friends and discovered a place of joy and safety.  The river
is mine, with its kingfishers and ducks, dragonflies and fish.  I have
come home, and I do not want to leave just yet.

It is a great relief to finally have this finished.  I am sorry if some
of you have dreaded it arriving every sporadic time.  i hope those of
you who have read it have enjoyed coming on this great adventure with
me.  I'll let you know when I'm off on another one.

THANK YOU to all who helped bring Cori home, especially to Julian who
triumphed in the face of all adversity and made the whole trip possible.
Also of course, dear Andy, who gave me the boat in the first place and
who
will no doubt want help bringing her to her next resting place once he
returns from his adventures next year.
The Wynns also deserve a special mention for being there every step of
the way and giving such love and encouragement, especially at Easter
time.
And to Kev and Sarah who travelled such huge distances, only to have me
risking their lives and flapping horrendously, as usual.

If you are passing through or near Bishops Stortford then do look me up.
 There is always space, or we'll find some somewhere.
