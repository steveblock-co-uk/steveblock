The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Fifteen

</PRE><A NAME="Day22"><PRE>
DAY TWENTY-TWO 17/04/04 - Too many skippers

Having arrived at Cheddington in the depths of darkness, I arise with
Kevin and Julian and we set off in the morning under batteries at 8.20. 
Julian is being far too enthusiastic about the water wildlife, trying to
make friends with a swan.  The swan responds by biting his ankles and
hissing a lot to which Julian responds with something like 'Whose a nice
swanyy swan then'.  *Sigh*  Maybe 'HISSSSSSSS  Flap Flap BITE BITE
HISSSSSSSSSSSSS' means 'Have a good day and I hope you don't hit
anything today' in Swan language.  I threaten to bash it on the beak
with a mug if it gets too close.

I am so busy waving my mug at the swan I don't pay attention to where my
feet are going.  Walking up and down the roof is a hazard because it's
covered in lumps of wood, a canoe, the wretched gantry thing and two
chimneys.  Instead you can risk the the two walkways on either side of
the boat that run about a foot above the waterline.  It is possible to
get rather blase about these. 
I have got rather blase about these.
I manage to dip my foot into the canal up to my knee.  Doh.  We put my
socks on the roof to dry, Both Julian and Kevin exclaiming in horror at
the fact I not only have odd socks, but 4 different odd socks at that
(Two on each foot).  I am also wearing my rather spangly Rohan trousers
that turn into shorts at the blink of an eye and a fiddle with zips.  I
have to dry these leggy bits out as well, and so we end up with strange
creature on the roof as each item of clothing is spread out in a cross
shape under one of the tyre fenders.  It looks like someone is sprawled
on the roof having fallen from a terrible height.

By 0840 we're at Marsworth Flight, 6 locks in all.  They are big and
pretty, but not as nice as the Northampton ones.  Kevin has drawn a
beautiful sketch of Marsworth in the logbook, but I have no scanner. 
You'll have to come and visit if you want to see it, but it's very good.
We also munch on some hot cross buns, and Julian scoffs nearly all of
them!
I rescue a toad out of one of the locks which the other two find very
funny. 
'Help Help I'm trying to be rescued!' cries Julian as I take another
swipe at the toad from the roof, missing completely.  After about ten
minutes faffing I have the toad and have set him free in some nice damp
hedgerow.

We also meet 'Owlet' a very lovely boat with a much bigger engine with a
lovely couple and there grandaughter on.  I invite them to dinner in
Stortford as that's where they're heading.  (But I think I've missed
them as I haven't seen them yet).

We leave the Marsworth flight at 1120 and bid farewell to Owlet who are
steaming ahead.

At 1250 we enter Cowroast Lock and I get very excited as for the first
time we're going Down locks and not Up them!  A sign we are getting
closer to London.  Here we also fill up with water and Kevin and me go
to investigate the Chandlery.  There's lots of brass plates with the
names of various rivers and canals (and tunnels...) on.  I pick up a
huge pile in an assortment of colours that would cover our journey.  I
suddenly think of Andy's face when he sees his engine room doors covered
in brass plates that all cost about £7 each.  I put them back.  Even the
Blisworth Tunnel one, which was Black.

We get a ring from Andy, he's on the Broads in a pub with lots of
Morning Star friends and having a jolly time.  He and Rachel Morrell, a
Morning Star type who I have only met briefly before, are going to come
out and meet us in the afternoon.  How jolly.  I enthusiastically agree
and try to give them some idea of where we're going to be.

When they ring off I suddenly feel rather odd about Andy coming out back
to his boat.  She's been mine for a good couple of weeks, (although she
has also rather been very much Julian's as well).  I have been making
the decisions and sorting out the problems and co-ordinating people and
running all over the country and panicing about gas and worrying about
the lack of toilets.  How will it be with Andy back as Skipper?  I
suddenly feel like a shadow has fallen over the day, despite the
sunshine, but soon shake it off.  It'll be fine.

1402 Dudswell Lock
1409 Exit

1440  Meet Owlet again at Northchurch Lock
The chap on Owlet has a very snazzy Brompton fold up bicycle which he is
cycling ahead to open locks with.  I am very envious.  They open the
locks for us too, what nice people.  

1450 Exit lock.  I got left on the wrong side of a lock whilst closing
it up and made a bit of a leap of faith onto the back of Cori, ending up
as a heap on the engine room floor.  How we laughed...

1455 Bushes Lock
1500 Exit lock, Owlet chappie steaming ahead on Brompton

1513 Gas 1 lock where lies a waiting Owlet.
1520 Exit lock having found a plastic bag wrapped around the propeller.

1525 Enter Gas 2 Lock where Owlet tie up just beyond to do some
shopping.
1530 onwards

1540 Berkhamstead Lock where some over excited children feeding the
ducks open the lock gates for us.  Awwww bless.

1600 Ravens Lane Lock
1610 Exit

1613 Rising Sun Lock
We are now well into Berkhamstead and are walking along a towpath in the
middle of a town.  The sun is shining and there are daffodils, but there
are also lots of people, so I don't pick any.  There are a lot of old
converted buildings that used to be canally lining the banks of the
canal at this point, most of which are pubs.  Lots of leary men anyway.
1620 Exit lock and another phone call from Andy and Rachel.  They're not
too far away and coming to find us.

1630 Lots of willow trees that Kev and me aim underneath.  I think we
were all singing daft songs by this point and enjoying the glorious
weather.
1645 Topside Lock (HUGE drop)
1652 Leave lock, Julian with the phone glued to his ear trying to guide
Andy and Rachel to us.

1657 Moor up alongside the river to await our new crew.  Strnage squeaky
noise.  A chaffinch or someones riusty tiller?  We don't know.

1707 Boarded by Andy and Rachel who look very boaty.
It's good to meet Rachel properly, we've only passed each other at the
Morning Star Conference in the summer so finally have a chance to get to
know each other.  She hasn't done narrowboats before so this is
something of an adventure, though not as adventuresome as sailing a boat
on the Norfolk Broads for a week which is what she's just been doing.
Urgh.  Far too much land around them Broads for my liking.... unless I
was doing it in Cori of course!
Andy takes the map and tries to work out where we're going to be later. 
I point out we won't be where he thinks we'll be because we don;t go
that fast.  He snorts.  We continue.

1713 Bottom Side Lock
Someone is lying down under the lock gate bars!  Right where I want to
put my feet while opening the doors!
"I'm terribly sorry if I step on you." I say, whilst thinking "Serves
you right if I do you galloot, what a stupid place to have a nap."
He drowsily half opens one eye.  
Andy and me push together at the bar, trying not to giggle too much, or
step on the recumbent twit.
1720 Exit lock, no stepped on casulties...

1730 Sewer Lock (by Berkhemstead Sewage Works.  How apposite.)
1738 Exit
1740 Moor up at bridge 145 to sort out cars.  Rachel has one, so she and
Julian and kev go off to sort theirs out and get them all in the right
places, but Rachel soon returns having taken Julian to his.
1810 Rachel returns.  Julian and kevin will meet us further downstream.

1820 I have set Rachel at the helm, knowing no one is going to crash as
spectacularly as i have, and there's only one way to learn and that's by
doing.  Rachel is pretty good, these tiller sailors, she'll be fine.  We
go have a bit of a collision with a tree before the next lock, and Andy
stands on the bank with the lock key looking sardonic, but before too
long we've disentangled ourselves (thanks to my trusty pole) and entered
Winkwell Lock 1.
1827 We leave the lock

1832 Winkwell Lock 2, and would you believe it, another twit is lying
down under the gate bars.  it looks like the same person....  I am
tempted to give him a poke with my toe, but resist.  what is it with
this part of the world and people sleeping in silly places?

1840 Exit lock.  Andy and Rachel are getting into the swing of them now
and I am helming.  Silly really.  I am pretty dreadful at helming
anyway, what with me having the attention span of a confused gnat and
always getting distracted by butterflies or brightly coloured boats or
passers by or the log book, but I am even worse when being watched by
Cori's owner!  Don't manage to take off much paint though.

1845 Go through swing bridge

1847 Winkwell Lock 3
1855 Exit

1910 Boxmoor Top Lock where we meet up with Kev and julian, Julians car
somewhere ahead, Kev's in the car park.
Andy disappears below to cook tea.  Rachel and me carry on, the light is
beginnng to go and there's a lovely sunset happening.
1925 Fishey Lock
1940 Exit
2000 Boxmoor Lock
2010 Exit
2022 Stop at Frogmore End, or at least try to.
"Dinner's very nearly ready," shouts Andy from the steamy galley. "You
should be thinking of stopping."

We think about stopping under some nice willow trees on the right hand
bank, but go aground.  We go a little further on, and run aground.  It
appears the canal has been designed with very shallow edges so boaties
can't just moor up where they like when they want their dinner.  What
swines!

We have to carry on to Apseley Lock.  "It's going to be cold" comes an
exasperated shout.  We moor up, and just as I am tying on the bow rope I
get approached by a funny little man who tell me we should be further on
where it's more sheltered.
(There is no wind)
"It's going to be really cold soon" echoes up from below.
I say we don't mind and that we'll be fine and the funny little man
starts telling me about how he always walks here and how boats always
moor up but how it's much more sheltered further on and where have we
come fom and she's not a very usual boat is she and what's your name and
can I shake your hand?
2100 With difficulty I extract myself and head below for a well deserved
tea.  Much music, fires and jollification.
