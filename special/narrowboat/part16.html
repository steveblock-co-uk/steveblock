The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Sixteen

</PRE><A NAME="Day23"><PRE>
DAY TWENTY THREE 18/04/04 - And then there were Seven....

0840 We set off from Apsely Lock.
For the first time in almost the whole trip it was raining.  Not your
average 'oh well it might stop in a minute' british rain, not even that
really lovely warm summer rain that makes everything smell green.  No,
this was grimacing, sulky, grey rain that had malicious intent to stay
all day.

As a result of this, there is very little in the log book relative to
other days, because it couldn't live on deck and got a bit forgotten
about.  i shall remember what I can though.  On board are myself, Kevin,
Julian, Andy and Rachel and we are bound south, through Hemel Hempstead
towards London.  I am feeling rather harrassed by so many people, and
the weather, and by being exhausted, and the fact everyone seems to be
telling me what to do.

0842 (In damp and therefore sketchy biro) Through Apsely.  (Made more
unreadable as it was written by Andy ;op)
0847 Kevin makes his exit off to rescue his car from a pub car park,
apparently carrying most of his life with him!
0850 Apsely Lock 2
0905 Exit.  Rain.  Sogginess. Urgh.
0911 Apsely Lock 3
0920 Exit headed under bridge.
0930 Speak to Francoise on the phone and agree to meet her on the other
side of a posh housing estate along with Katie.
0935 Nash Mills Lock
0942 Exit, having removed a plastic bag from the prop.
0945 Kevin Returns!  It turns out the car park is chained shut and the
poor chap has just run all the way back to us along the river bank. 
He's going to miss a family Sunday dinner back at home, on his loooong
drive back up to Keswick.  We all sympathise as he clambers back aboard.
 Red Lion Lock.
0950 Exit
1020 Arrive at Kings Langley Lock.  Much rain and wetness, but I am
convinced that it's trying to get brighter.  See a long tailed tit and a
greenfinch so I am happy.
1030 Exit

1100 Enter Holm Park Lock and Francoise and Katie arrive.
1110 Exit.  So does Kevin, for the 2nd time.  Julian and Rachel go as
well to shunt cars with Francoise.  Katie, Andy and me continue in the
rain.  

It's a bit miserable.  Everything is really wet.  Everyone is really
wet.  Katie takes things very well, despite only being two and a half. 
She sits on the roof while I steer and Andy attempts to fasten a large
clamp to her coat.  She tries to fasten it to his nose....
We all hoot under the M25 road bridge... London is within our grasp!

1125 Looks like 'Enter River Gade Lock' but a bit wet and smuged and
hard to read.
1240 Due to minding Katie and attempting to concentrate on steering at
the same time while Andy did various things in the engine room, we lost
rather a lot of time.  Hunton bridge Locks 1&2 are passed, and Lady
Capel Lock as well.  
1242 This bit I remember clearly.  katie wanted a drink, or some food or
something and was having a a good shout.  There was a very sharp bend to
the right, and then a very narrow bridge, and a large overhanging tree
that I was trying to protect Katie from being attacked by.  
Then there was a resounding bang as I didn't manage to make it quite
through the bridge but more into it instead.
'One broken glass, no fatalities' records the log, but I think Andy was
a bit cross...
1247 Another bridge (166) it's still raining.

1310 Leaving Cassiobury pair of locks.
1550 Bridge 175
1600 We had missed out a large part of all the locks of the afternoon,
mainly due to the weather and the proximty of so many wet and strong
charactered people on board.  I am feeling very stressed and hide away
as much as I can, leaving Andy, Francoise and Rachel to steer and dear
Julian looking after the delightful Kate.  There is a lot of car
shunting to do and people come and go to move them throughout the day.
Locks completed:
Iron bridge Lock
Cassio Bridge Lock
Common Moor Lock
Lot Mead Lock
Batchworth Lock
Stokes Lock

1640.  julian and I heave a huge sigh of relief as everyone leaves. 
narrowboating in the rain with too many people is not to be done. 
Especially it is not to be done when over stressed from having spent two
weeks running backwards and forwards from the edge of Essex to heavens
knows where in the country with only public transport to rely on. 
Definitely not to be done if over tired.  Definitely not to be done if
feeling the pressure of organising everyone and everything.
Julian and I wave farewell to Andy, Rachel, Francoise and kate and
continue alone into the rain, hoods up, waterproofs on, feet frozen,
faces set.

1655  We enter Coppermill Lock.  It feels like it's starting to get dark
(impossible) as the sky is so grey and the aspect so dismal.
1715  We exit the lock.  Now in the navigation guide it warns you about
a particularly nasty outflow just below it.  Julian and I can see the
surge of water churning up the canal from a large dark orifice in the
canal bank to the left, but having not met anything like this before,
and being very very tired and rather stressed out, we plough on,
thinking everything will be fine, trying to stay to the right hand side
of the canal.

BANG!
We enter the current, the bow is blasted to the right, everything goes a
bit wrong and wobbly, there are various crashes from within and we
cannon into the right hand bank.
Miraculously after a few moments of madness as the rest of Cori's 58
feet get through the current, we discover nothing is damaged and no
paintwork has been lost.  However, with our morale already at its lowest
ebb so far, and the weather so horrid, we are both rather shaken up and
feel rather depressed.

1735  The delightfully titled 'Black Jack's Lock'.  Even this fails to
perk up our spirits as we plough on getting colder and colder.
1750  Exit the lock.  Cannot bear the generator any longer so switch to
batteries which are very very slow, but at least silent and don't add to
our feeling of general despair.  It's such a long way still, there is
all of London to get through, and the Lee, and the Stort.  Such a
marathon!  We are well over half way, but with the greyness and the
continual relentless rain it feels like an impossible task.  I make a
hot chocolate for us both in an attempt to lift our spirits.  Julian,
stoic at the helm, the water dripping down his nose and plopping into
his mug, trying to smile and make light conversation as we chug on and
on.

The Grand Union, near London, is not particularly pleasant.  Oh, there
are fields, and cute little pubs, but the waters are wide and busy. 
Perhaps in better weather it would have appeared as lovely as earlier
parts of the trip, but in the rain it is like passing through purgatory.

1820 We reach Widewater Lock, but do not feel that we can go on.  We
turn the boat around and go back a little way to find a morring.  By
1850 we have stopped and the light really is going.  I get the fire
going as it really quite chilly, and Julian bustles about in the
kitchen.  I get a bit spaced out, a combination of absolute exhaustion
and an adverse reaction to a very long and harrassed day in the rain.  I
spend most of the next couple of hours curled up and wobbly on the futon
next to the fire while Julian looks concerned and makes me eat lots.  I
apologise for being rubbish and then fall asleep.  By 9pm we are in
Julians car and heading back to Stortford.  I've got work tomorrow.

Julian heads back to Reading for a pitstop, and I manage to persuade my
father that he would really like to help Julian get the boat through
London.  My part in the epic is now at an end, apart for one last day,
and we leave the tale, and Coroskeir, in Julians capable hands.
