The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Thirteen

</PRE><A NAME="Day19"><PRE>
DAY NINETEEN - 14/04/04 - AN AQUADUCT YOU SAY?

Having survived the horrors of Blisworth and Stoke Bunion, we awoke to a
clear and beautiful morning, once again having totally failed to catch
unwary cyclists in our mooring lines.  Drat.
Julian and Kevin were up in a flash and by 8am we had departed while
Graham and me cooked breakfast.  poor Sarah was still recovering from the
previous day and we left her to slumber while we chugged on.  The
countryside was a tapestry of rolling green fields on gentle hillsides,
the slender oaks and ash trees lining the river seeming to dip down to
meet Coroskier as we motored along.  At 830 we met some dredgers in the
middle of the canal and had to slow to a crawl to avoid them.  I think i
took over helming at some point after this because we weent aground at
9am, and if I remember correctly it was because I gave way to another
boat and got pushed into the reeds as a result, the swine!

By 10 o'clock we had reached Cosgrove, a very genteel little town nestled
on the side of a hill.  The approach to Cosgrove is under an absurdly
ornate Gothic Bridge, which looked extremely fetching in the morning
light.  many pictures taken.

We moored up and took on water, and ended up chatting to a couple from
Cambridge.  They seemed rather impressed by our journey and gave us some
tips for London.  Our only tip on London so far was 'Don't go through
Camden on a weekend or overnight', but this was now couple with 'Stop at
the big Tescoes on Bull Bridge junction'.  Very good.
Here Graham decided he had had enough of narrowboating with a crackpot
crew and said his goodbyes.  i think he actually had to go and look after
his gran, very honourable :o)

Kevin departed with him to retrieve his car.  We settled down to listen
to the chattering birds and enjoy the peace of the sunshine.
NEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

It appears we are moored right under a flight path for low flying jet
fighter planes.  Whatever birds there are decide not to bother trying to
compete with the jet, and we are left with the shattered stillness.

By 1120 Kevin has returned and taken Julian off to retrieve his car and
then do a bit of car shuffling.  Sarah and me continue on across the
aquaduct.  After about 5 minutes we round a corner and discover a lock. 
Drat.
The lock doesn't take very lng, and then we are on our first aquaduct. 
We are very excited, but it's a bit of an anticlimax as there are lots of
trees in the way and you can't actually tell you are on an aquaduct at
all.  It just looks like a normal canal.
Disappointed we carry on, seeing some very gaily painted boats festooning
the canal banks.  A flash of yellow on the starboard side, it's a
brimstone butterfly!  I have never seen them before, beautiful things, a
fantastic shade of sunshine yellow, but the novelty of them wears off
after the twentieth or so as we progress.

There is one point on the aquaduct where there are no trees, and you
realise you are actuallly quite high up, and there's a really pretty
river beneath, and gosh isn't it lovely?  but all too soon those wretched
trees are back and the moment passes.  Give me a day with a chainsaw....

As we approach Milton Keynes (argh!  As if Northampton and Blisworth
weren't enough, a new terror to face!  Now we know why Graham jumped
ship....) we pass under a bridge and are confronted by a boat full of
holiday makers.  I am rather heartened when they make a complete hash of
things and collide with the bridge with a resounding bang.  not just me
then :o)

At 1230 we are moored up against the bank using the funny corrogated bank
holding back material as a mooring point.  Julian has given me a walkie
talkie so we can hear them when they are nearby, but there appears to be
someone else on our channel.
"What do you want in your sandwiches?" I think I hear at one point.
He is 'Aethelstan' (he is an Anglo-Saxon you know) and I am Coroskeir. 
gosh how original.  While we wait I start to Brasso the nav lights. 
Might have been more productive if I'd connected them to the 12 volt
batteries instead....

By 1pm they return, all cars in correct places.  Off we go, after a bit
of a fight with the mooring ropes which have got themselves jammed the
rotters.  Milton Keynes isn't so bad from the canal.  At one point we go
over another aquduct, with not a tree in sight.  I stand on the roof and
flail my armsx at the traffic passing underneath, and much to my
disappointment, completely fail to cause an accident.  must be losing my
touch.  I don't even see a roundabout!

Milton Keynes was quite a pleaseant cruise in the end.  I was singing and
helming for most of it.  We serenaded lots of people with harmony songs
like 'Down to the River to Pray' and 'Oh You'll Never get to Heaven' and
'the Chemical Workers Song'.  no one threw any money at us though, I am
sure that was only because they couldn't hear us over the generator. 
There are a lot of nice houses that run down to the river, and lots of
green spaces with beautiful trees and shrubs growing down to the waters
edge.  there are also tonnes of bridges which I faithfully hooted under,
although the rest of the crew appeared to tire of this game.  We also
played 'Get the boat under the willow branches' whenever we passed
underneath a weeping willow which was great fun.

The problem with this bit was that we were doing a huge right angled turn
all the way through MK, so although we ended up covering a lot of miles,
we didn't really progress very far south.

We stopped for Hot Cross Bunnies at Fenny Stratford, very attractive
looking place with a very interesting swing bridge that we didn't get to
see working.  Looks like it was to stop people falling into the lock on
their return from the pub however.

By 7pm we were steaming out of MK, and reached the most beautiful and
memorale moment of the day, an avenue of stately poplars, reflected
perfectly in the still, cool waters of the Grand Union.  there wasn't a
ripple on the water except for us, whispering along under the batteries. 
Kevin sat on the roof reading the earlier pagers of the boat epic, and I
just tried to drink as much of the memory in as possible to keep for dark
miserable evenings.

We reached and passed willowbridge marina, and I then waved at lots more
cars on the A1416, but no one saw me :o(
We stopped at about half seven and had dinner, and then all drove into
Milton Keynes to find Kev's car.  julian headed back to Coroskeir and the
three of us, Kev Sarah and I, headed back to Stortford to try and sleep
before I set off for work in the morning.  All I rememebr of the journey
is completely failing to find any music on the radio, and it only taking
about an hour.  If only the boat could travel so fast.....
