The Great Narrrowboat Move - Part Two

</PRE><A NAME="Day2"><PRE>
DAY TWO - 27/03/04

A grey dawn over Steatham dry dock.  Andy and I rub our eyes, scoff some
grub and get stuck in.

More angle grinding, only now we possess masks.  This gives you several
personal protection clothing options:
1.  You can wear the mask.  This makes breathing slightly more pleasant
and snot a bit less black.
2.  You can wear the safety glasses.  This limits the chances of getting
sparks, rust, paint/metal dust/ chips of metal in your eyes.
3.  You can wear the ear defenders. (or extremely disgusting and possibly
biohazardous ear plugs if you're Andy - he gives them a scrub in the sink
to get the worse of the gunge off)  This means that you don't have a
constantly singing head once the power tools are silenced.
4.  You can wear a combination of the above.

Now, the combination option is obviously the most sensible.  The ear
defenders are excellent and have no negative effects at all, apart from
sometimes forgetting you're wearing them, removing the balaclava and
throwing them into a pile of crud somewhere under the boat.
The mask and goggles are problematic.  Should they be worn at the same
time, the goggles steam up and it is impossible to see.  This means you
either have to take them off and wipe them every 30 seconds, which is
highly irritating, or squint through the nose bridge/sides, thus risking
the chance of getting all the nasties above in your eyes anyway.  Oh
well, can't see very well out of one eye anyway.  

This day feels much faster.  Not only do we manage to toally scrape, wire
brush and sand the port side, but we get it painted, and the stern and
bow topsides of the starboard side!  This leaves the starboard middle
topsides and the port topsides to do.  Oh, and the bottom.  Andy has
mumbled something about maybe leaving it.  It's very skanky.  There
appear to be lots of different types of moulds living on it, and the
ground beneath is covered in a kind of rusty, wet goo from all the work
we've been doing.  Yuck.

We are using mini rollers, an excellent invention.  The paint goes on
really quickly and gives a lovely finish.  Unfortunately the paint is
really really evil, causing a chemical reaction on the roller, meaning
they disintegrate after not very much use!  Instead of paint bristles
like the starboard side, the port side is covered in lots of little blobs
of roller material.  Urgh.

We stop and start to prepare dinner.  Libby comes to visit us, despite
the terrible directions I give her that gets her very confused and quite
lost.  Andy rescues her from driving round Streatham for a fourth time,
and a jolly, muck free evening ensues.

DAY THREE 28/03/04 

Lots of people come to visit us today.  First Lee comes from Cambridge. 
I have told him to wear dirty clothes... he arrives looking totally
immaculate but explains these *are* his dirty clothes, only he hasn't
ever had an opportunity to get them dirty.....  We'll soon fix that!
He and I finish the starboard topsides while Andy scrapes and grinds the
port topsides.

Julian arrives all the way from Reading.  He is going to be one of the
major movers of the boat while Andy is off sailing and I am flitting
backwards and forwards from work.  He looks slightly horrified at the
state of Andy and myself.  
(Both clothed in rags, daubed liberally with thick globs of tarry
bitumeny evil paint which we have read the label of today and in big
letters says 'MAY CAUSE CANCER - DO NOT GET IN CONTACT WITH ANYTHING!!!'
Our hands are covered in the stuff.  Oh dear.)  We are both pretty dusty
too, and look like something from a 1950's horror film with all of the
safety gear on.

We carry on.

Anne arrives from Bristol.  Anne is there as moral support and to try and
work on her Physiology while we angle grind.  Somehow she manages to do
this while the boat vibrates around her!

Now the topsides are almost done, Lee heads off back to Cambridge, his
clothes not that much more dirty.  Shame ;o)  THANK YOU for your help!

We look again at the bottom.  It's really really horrid under there.  The
boat rests on 3 concrete buttresses spread evenly down her length.  There
are therefore 4 sections underneath, each about 4 metres long or
thereabouts.  The boat is 2 metres wide, meaning there are four quite
large sections beneath that will have to be scraped, ground and then
painted.  The fungus glowers at us.  The primordal gloop shimmers darkly.
 There is only about 2 feet of clearance to wriggle underneath.  The
proximity of the dry dock walls and the newness of the paint on the boat
means that getting down that low is actually rather difficult without
dipping yourself in the slime.

Andy, ever the hero, descends on a board and starts scraping.

"It's really really horrid under here"
The fungus makes soft, moist "phlut" noises as it is scraped off.  The
rusty soup gets more and more disgusting.

We manage to start the second coat of paint.  I decide that it's really
unfair for Andy to do all the horrid scraping alone, so swop while he
paints far a bit.

I shall set the scene.  You are lying on you back on a rough wooden
plank, nanometres from the rusty, and now mychorrizal soup under the
boat.  Above is the rough, pitted surface of the bottom covered in large
organic lumps.  Imagine something from the 'Alien' film set.  As you
scrape, there is splatterage.  You are wearing clothes that really ought
to be burnt, a rough woollen balaclava, worn safety gloves, goggles you
can't see out of, a mask you can barely breathe through, and waving a
piece of disposable saw around like a maniac.  It's really really really
really dreadful.

However, it's not half as dreadful as doing the same thing but with an
angle grinder instead of a scraper.  This creates thick, choking clouds
of rust dust that clog your eyes and gag your breath if you make any
attempt to look at how things are going.  Andy and I resort to flailing
wildly about with our eyes tightly shut, trying to remember which bits
we've done.  Truly truly awful.

But the evening makes up for it.  The boat is now painted, apart from the
bottom, with only one more coat required.  We have two bottles of wine
and lots of grub and then sing late into the night.
The evening is only marred by the knowledge that I have to get up at 5.50
in order to cycle to Ely and catch the train back to Bishops Stortford to
go to work.  Anne's company is worth it though :o)

DAY FOUR 29/03/04

5.50 Start for me.  I leave the boat and wobble off into the dark on my
knackered mountain bike, along the A10 with no lights.  Manage to survive
and get to work, although I feel like the waking dead.

Meanwhile, Julian and Anne paint the sides and get them finished, and
then head off to various parts of the country.  THANK YOU BOTH!!!  Andy
is joined by Andy Challis.  They have a go at the bottom and decide to
sod scraping it.  They also bring the landrover into the yard and divest
it of its crane and spare engine.  Cyril (the pirate with one arm and a
glass eye) will help us move them onto the boat with a tractor tomorrow).
 They paint the bottom with thick, nasty bitumen.  By the time Andy
Challis leaves in the evening (THANK YOU), we are ready to go.  The boat
is shiny and black and lovely, apart from all of the green paint above
the waterline which is all rusty and patchy.  But we know that the bit
under the water will be immaculate... :o)

I arrive at 2230, and Julian soon after.  We sink into our sleeping bags
excited by the prospect of our first ever voyage tomorrow!
