The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Fourteen

DAY TWENTY 15/04/04 - Serendipity

i AWAKE IN THE FLAT AT SOME gOD AWFUL TIME AND HAVE TO GO TO WORK.  kEV
AND sARAH SLUMBER ON AND ARE GOING TO TRY AND MEET ME AT LUNCHTIME IN THE
FOREST.  bONKERS DAY, SUN AND THEREFORE LOTS OF PEOPLE.  wHEN sARAH AND
KEV ARRIVE i'M SCURRYING ABOUT EMPTYING BINS AND SORTING OUT THE TOILETS
AND HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO SHOW THEM ROUND.  vERY UPSETTING.  i LIKE MY
FOREST AND WANT TO SHOW IT TO PEOPLE!

oHHH, WHOOPS, MANAGED TO LEAVE cAPS lOCK ON....

(I have already typed all this out once but have managed to press
something that has wiped it all.  Grrrrrrrrrrrr.)
Anyway.

Kev decides to go and help Julian on the boat instead of going home. 
This makes Kevin an Officially Good Egg and he receives many thankyous
from me.  

Julian meanwhile is on the boat buying keys for water points and
pumpouts, groceries and investigating gas.  No good on the gas front.  He
also embarks on several boat improvement projects.

The Blinds
Andy's blinds are a bit unpredictable.  Sometimes they go up and down. 
SOmetimes they only unroll.  SOmetimes they explode, normally in the
hands of unsuspecting children, and shower bits of plastic all over the
boat.  Sometimes they only go halfway.  by the time I gt back to the boat
they all work perfectly.

The Doors
Lying in bed on a boat at night, you are bound to be assailed by a
variety of different noises.  One noise Julian particularly dislikes is
the creaking of the doors.  I quite like it, unless it's me that's
forgotten to close it.  The worst one is the loo.  Now they are all
silent.

The Light
Julian has got fed up with doing nasty dark night passages and has made a
lovely light for the front so we never have to 'Blisworth' ever again. 
The hand torch looks very jealous.

The Bang
Whenever you switch from the generator back to batteries, you have to
unscrew a connector from one bolt and attach it to the other, creating
the circuit.  The Power Units have a capacitor each and this stores up a
charge which is released when you create the new circuit to the
batteries.  As there is nowhere for this energy to go, it is released in
the form of brilliant sparks and a loud BANG which always makes the
person doing the task leap about five feet in the air and then have to go
and check if they've still got their eyebrows.  not good when you're in
the engine room where there isn't really spce to jump out of your skin!
Julian has now fitted resistors to first press the connectors to before
attaching them to the batteries.  much less fun, as this takes away the
charge and stops the sparks, but it'll stop Julian's hair going
prematurely grey.

Kev arrives by 1830 and they depart having sorted out cars and things. 
They go through the whimisically titled 'Three Locks of Soulbury' by
1930, and moor up 'just below bridge 109' by 2000.  Kev then dons a pair
of goggles and attacks my bit of metal out of a hedge with the angle
grinder.  There is a big square bolt on the 'Lucky' which makes driving
it into the ground with a sledgehammer a bit of a pain.  No longer.  Oh,
and the dratted exhaust has fallen off again.  Will have to be fixed in
the morning.... Guitars and bed first!

DAY TWENTY ONE 16/04/04 - PHEW!

It's Andy's birthday today, but he's on Morning Star so we totally fail
to have a party for him.

I am still having to work in the forest after a very enjoyable evening
discussing the finer points of veganism and buddhism with Sarah.  Gosh,
how I have missed our late night chats!  it's just like being bck in our
old house in York, only without the mess and the ever present cat hairs. 
Sadly I say goodbye and she heads off to London, with her limp.  Poor
Sarah, I hope you are much improved!!!!

On the boat...
0950 - Kev and julian have fixed the exhaust back in place and set off.
1030 - They pass under an extremely majestic weeping willow.  There
appearto be lots along this part of the waterways network for all you
willow enthusiasts.
They enter a lock at somepoint, before leaving it at 1100.
1115 - wyvern shipping company marina entered to look for gas
1128 - exited, decision made to buy it later in the day
1225 - Grove lock
1235 - Exit
1255b - Church Lock
1310 - Exit
1330 Lunch on the move, sandwiches and juice on the roof.  Warm and
mostly sunny al morning but beginning to cloud over.
1355 - Re-fill genny
1405 - Slapton Lock
1425 - Exit
14?? - Horton Lock
1458 - Exit
15?? - Ivinghoe Lock (Part 1)
1533 - Exit
Very sunny now apparently, both down to bare torsos and shorts.  Kev
walks ahead to open up Part 2.
1540 Ivinghoe Lock (Part 2)
1552 Exit, being hassled by yahoos in a hired boat who are trying to
steam in first.  Rotters.
1615 1st Seabrook Lock, having politely waited for boat to exit.
1652 Exit the second lock.  Three boat go through this lock together,
Cori taking up one side and the other two (only twenty footers) both
fitting in one behind the other on the opposite side!  Well I never...
1658 - Third Seabrook lock.  Kevin and one of the short boat women (That
a woman off the short boats, not a short woman) go ahead to open it.
1708 - Exit Seabrook
1715 - Get out of the way as the shorter and much more powerful boats
plough ahead.  How embarressing.
1730 - Moor up at Cheddington, baking hot.

Having worked two very busy days at the forest, I return to Cori,
arriving at Cheddington sometime in the bowels of the night and cursing
my bad luck as I have just gone down the entire stretch of Grand Union on
the train but been unable to see it because it's dark!  Wonderful dinner,
many boat improvements, and a very happy and brown pair of friends to
return to.  it's good to be home!
