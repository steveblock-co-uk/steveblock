The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Nine

</PRE><A NAME="Day12"><PRE>
DAY TWELVE CONTINUED - 7/04/04 - A SECOND AND MORE TERRIBLE DISASTER

Julian has been left alone, nursing his terribly swollen and painful knee
on the boat.  The diesel engine glowers darkly at him from behind the
forecabin curtains and underneath the tarpaulin.  I imagine that Julian
glowers back, though wincing with pain.  At 1900 Julian makes a terrible
discovery.

Andy's boat has a holding tank system - that is, a big box for poo
underneath the toilet in the heads (nautical speak for a lavatory). 
Other boats have porta potti's - like a caravan, or casette toilet where
all the waste ends up in a nice, briefcase sized box you carry to a
disposal station and flush away.  I recounted our encounters with the
pumpout station when we went to Ely.  We thought we had done very well. 
There was some clever switch on the pumpy thing that told you when it was
empty....

Apparently not.  Apparently there is just a simple timer that switches
the pump off after a certain amount of time.

Julian, in all his pain, discovers that there is effluent leaking out
from the bottom of the toilet, oozing its slimey way to the edge, and
then sliding down underneath the floorboards into the bilges.  Oh.  WHat
a lovely surprise.  The holding tank is full, the toilet is out of action
and there is poo everywhere.

Julian is wracked with guilt.  In Peterborough Andy had told him to pump
out for free at the station, but Julian had refused, seeing as we had
only pumped out a few days before and it meant turning the boat around. 
Now he is overwhelmed by his negative emotions, and all alone mops up the
poo, berating himself soundly for his mistake.

7 miles and 3 locks

DAY THIRTEEN - 08/04/04 - Miles and miles of Guilt

There wasn't going to be a day thirteen.  Julian was going to get off the
boat and go off to be an Anglo Saxon (which he does when he's not being a
hero on board the narowboat) for the weekend, building a meeting house
out of traditional materials (and large metal bolts and screws due to
health and safety) in the middle of a wood in Canterbury.  Regia Anglorum
are the group if you would like to look them up - sounds like a great
laugh.  http://www.geocities.com/aelfgarmedwaeg/ for pictures of the long
hall under construction. 
(http://community.webshots.com/photo/113880686/114212917EXKMtL The one in
the green shirt on the right is Julian.)

He felt so bad at the great poo disaster, that he continued on, despite
hardly being able to walk due to the pain in his knee from the wretched
engine.

Here are the log entries.  I have embellished some of them.

1115 Depart under generator power.
1140 Ashton Lock.  Stop genny as charger thinks batteries are fully
charged: 51V no load, 58.5V max at 4 minutes charging; 48V half load. 
(?????  Greek to me but Julian and Andy understand it, so that's ok)

1235 Set off, with difficulty due to bad knee & on-shore wind.  (Poor
Julian - she's not the easiest boat to get off in the best of times, let
alone whilst limping along a towpath!)

(I think there was a lock in here somewhere, but it's not noted. 
Nevermind)

1410 Depart. Hail shower.
~1430 Oundle Marina. Very nice slow, controlled, sideways approach to
moor. Unfortunately no pump-out: the map is wrong or out of date. Get two
extra diesel cans and 17 litres for £16.93. Fill with water. Dispose of
rubbish. Use toilet. Get empty gas cylinder out of gas locker with much
struggle only to discover that it's not Calor (it's CPS) and they only
sell Calor.

(Oh Bum!  Wretched CPS gas appears to be a Cambridge only brand.  Andy's
gas locker is the hatch at the very front of the boat, designed to let
any leaking gas leak straight out and into the water, instead of seeping
into the bilges and going BANG when I turn the stove on at somepoint in
the future.  CPS gas is impossible to find.  I fear we're going to have
to reort to calor :o(
The Imray maps we got are great for telling us what way the river turns
and whether we are likely to get stuck under bridges, but it isn't very
useful at up to date information!)

1605 Depart.

1625 Upper Barnwell lock.

1705 Set off.

1745 Batteries nearly flat (<40V). Start genny. Charger not charging: it
has all day been saying, and still is saying they are fully charged:
battery symbol with all segments lit and a "battery full" light, even
though its voltage display read 35V (falling fast) by the time I switched
over. Disconnect charger from mains and from batteries (by pulling out
the green/black/red plug block). Re-connect after a couple of minutes.
Now it's charging.

(The big green/black/red plug block is part of the spaghetti wires
system.  One block connects the batteries to the 12volt domestic system,
allowing them to run the lights and water pumps and things on board, but
not the batteries.  The other switch connects them to the engine system,
allowing them to run the engine.  Julian has just completed the
'Cntrl-alt-dlt' manoevure for the engine and charger system that anyone
with a computer knows really well!)

1805 Lilford lock.

1845 Set off. Another boat comes in to the lock, following me, just as I
set off. That's the first time since Denver; in fact, the first other
boat I've seen using the river for days.

(The Nene really is deserted!)

1915 Stop genny (22 Ah charged). Approaching Wadenhoe lock. Other boat
has just caught up. I speed up so they don't overtake and use the lock
before me. It's a St. John's Ambulance boat being brought back from its
winter maintenance by about 7 crew. They point out that they can't share
the lock because it's a wide boat.

1940 Exit lock (helped by crew of other boat) & moor at the King's Head.
A young woman on a shorter narrowboat zooms into the spot I'm heading for
and then makes room for me to moor in front. As I land, she says "That's
not your boat, is it?" and we both say "It's Andy Rankin's". I try to get
dinner in the pub as advertised but they're not serving so I have to make
my own by which time it's late so I don't get to talk to her any more.

6.3 miles, 3 locks

So poor Julian, denied female company from Cambridge, resorts to phoning
me insted to update me on the days proceedings.  
"Do you want the good news or the bad news?"
I choose the bad news, whilst walking along the high street from the
library having been typing this up.  
"There is no toilet"
That is bad news indeed.  I'm heading out to the boat at the weekend and
inviting people to join me who definitely, definitely will want
facilities....
"But I've carried on"
Excellent news!  Every miles is one mile less, and we must be nearing the
halfway point now.....

</PRE><A NAME="Day14"><PRE>
DAY FOURTEEN -  9/04/04  Wadenhoe to Woodford

0935 Depart, by battery (49V no load).

1105 Genny on. (Batteries down to 40V at slow cruise.) Titchmarsh lock in
sight.

1125 Enter lock. Catherine & co. arrive by car but big locks on gate!
Find dirt track to park on & board boat on the bend before very very low
bridge.

(The problem I have been having with the Nene is that there isn't a
blinking railway station in sight.  Now that's fine if you're like 97% of
our population and drive everywhere... but for those of us with no car
and a rather wobbly pair of pins, getting from A-B can be a bit
difficult.  The Nene is a complete nightmare to arrange people to get out
to as it's miles away from everything, and my bicycle is rubbish. 
Luckily I have managed to persuade Lee, who helped with the scraping, to
bring his fiancee Sarah out to the boat for the day.  I meet them in
Cambridge in the morning, and we all drive out to the boat.  Before we
get there we go to the Tescos in Bar Hill, Cambridge.  Bar Hill is a
modern new town housing estate thing... the sort of place people wash
their cars and mow their lawns every Sunday.  It is also a mecca for
Tesco shoppers.  The Tescos is HUGE!  Bigger than HUGE, it's IMMENSE. 
You need a car to get round it!  It's like being in the NEC!  I spend the
trip going 'URGH!!!' and feeling agrophobic.  luckily we soon escape and
set off to try and find Julian.

After quite a lot of driving round following instinct rather than a map,
we discover him on the river at a marina, but the marina is shut with
great big gates and a padlock.  I persuade Lee to drive back onto the
main road and then along a little dirt track with big potholes, to park
in a ditch near a ford.  Lee doesn't look exactly thriled at the
prospect, but he and Sarah gamely grab the shopping and follow me, hop
skipping across the mud, over a gate and to the banks of the river to
meet the boat.)

1300 Having scoffed lunch we set off under the VLB.

We are rather worried about the bridge.  Rightly so, it is very very low.
 We check that the chimneys are both off, the one for the stove and the
one for the water heater.  

1305 Drop canoe over the side as it won't fit beneath.

1307 Catherine bridge jumps. (climbs it from the boat, scrambles over and
then drops down onto the boat again on the other side)

1310 Through unscathed, mm to spare.

1312 Preparing to come alongside the bank.

1317 Drop off Lee + Julian, Julian bound for all sorts of Anglo-Saxon
adventures at Wychurst, Lee to meet us in Islip. CB + SW continue alone,
canoe in tow, under generator 3/4 full (brief flap as to what's
4wards/backwards).

The day is absolutely blinking glorious.  The sun is shining and it's
really really warm.  The Nene is such a beautiful river, it meanders
through dense patches of scrub, with majestic willows and regal ash trees
lining the banks in between.  There are loads of moorhens and twittery
brown birds everywhere and I really just want to sing and sing and sing,
but I spare Sarah :o)  Sarah helms looking really happy.  I think she's
enjoying herself, despite the gRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR of the generator.

1335 Binky B on the port side. What a lovely shade of puce!  Another
boat!

1336 Zungeru soon after.  Two boats in the space of two minutes... it
really must be warm.  Rather frighteningly the chap driving Zungeru looks
exactly like Tim Millward.... I am staring over my shoulder....
CRASH

1337 Collide with left hand bank due to not paying attention -Urgh! 
That's what happens when you try and keep an accurate log.....

1412 Bridge I of III - bit rusty but successfully jumped.
1420 Passed by a boat of similar colours to us.  In fact, it could be us,
only with a much more powerful engine...
1425 Phone call from Lee + Julian, lost somewhere between Thepston +
Islip! (Not another bridge in sight, it appears the last one was I of I
:o<  Wretched map is wrong again...).
1445 Tie up at Islip Mill lock after brief faff involving half a tree
that is in the way under the water.
1450 Attempt to drag tree obstruction out of the way with the canoe. FAIL
:-(
1515 An intrepid canoe adventure set out upon by CB to find LM + JF. 
Julian and Lee had set out to the lock to find us, but not seen us moored
up beneath it.  They had set off along the bank, back the way we'd come,
hoping to spot us.  Luckily it's a lovely day, and despite Julian's
limping, when we finally phone them, it sounds like they've gone a rather
long way backwards.  I decide to go and get them in the canoe... much
more fun than walking back.

As i set off from the boat I am hailed from the shore by some fat man and
his family.
"If you're going to go native you should be naked" he remarks with a
leer.  I flick my paddle at him, and shoot under the bridge and out of
sight.  Yuck.

1530 Picked up on LH side of river + paddle back.  Very hard to find a
place where Julian can clamber into the canoe, his knee is a bit less
swollen, but still very very painful :o(  He now refers to himslef as
'The Old Man' through gritted teeth.

1600 After some gantry rearrangement - muffins + tea.  The gantry/crane
thing that had been seen sticking out of the landy when I first arrived
on the boat epic, is now on the roof.  Again Andy believes it is much
easier for people to view it that way.  They can view it, but it's in
bits as if it wasn't it wouldn't fit under any of the bridges.  Julian
and Andy had great fun bashing it to pieces while they were at the Denver
sluice.  It is a health hazard and is always snarling up the ropes.  I
would kick it everytime I walk past it, but I'd end up going head first
into the drink.

Anyone want a spare diesel engine?  £150
Gantry £50
Both in working order.  Well the gantry is, not sure about the engine. 
And that is I know the gantry works, but you will have to reassemble it.

1615 Joined by Peter, Francoise, Ben and Katie Wynn - again picked up
from the shore with all their clobber by canoe.  Peter takes Julian off
to find his car and we all wave goodbye.

Peter has already been on board Cori around March (the town not the
month) but the rest of his family want to help out too, can't have Daddy
having all the fun!  Francoise could be known as Nancy Blackett (of
Swallows and Amazons fame) Ben is five and a budding artist (especially
when it comes to boats) and Katie is two and a half and is always happy,
apart from when she isn't.  They are all introduced to Lee and Sarah and
vice versa, and then we cast off and set off into the lock.  Peter is
going to join us later on.

1630 Entered lock (Islip).
1700 Finished lock.

Pretty fast with all of us, but it could be faster.  The lock key makes a
huge difference.  I am letting Lee do the driving since the poor chap has
spent the whole day ferrying people from car to car.

1725 Moored up beyond big bridge, FW leaps into canoe to heroically
rescue PW!
Peter has agreed to meet us under a big bridge.  We are at a big bridge. 
I phone Peter, yes this is the right bridge.  Is it a viaduct?  Well its
got lots of arches and there are cars going over it, I suppose so. 
Goodbye.

1727 Everyone else carries on. - spot bigger bridge ahead.

This is a proper viaduct - really big arches and everything.  The light
is glorious as the sun begins to fall.
Bum.  Phone Peter back.

1735 Caught up, having discovered we're heading for the wrong bridge, by
FW in canoe.
1745 Canoe gets PW + brings him aboard, wave bye bye to JF.

Can't seem to say goodbye to Julian, this is the third time today!  This
time he really does head off for Wychurst and Anglo Saxon Adventures.

1810 Enter lock + drop off LM + SW - (Denford).

Here we leave Sarah and Lee who have things to do.  Thank you both so
very much, I couldn't have got out there without you and I really hope
that you enjoyed the day, despite the lack of a toilet!

1830 Out of lock + closing it down.
1925 Next lock (Woodford) - ROTTER motor boat hasn't bohtered to do the
lock back! Nasties!!!
1935 Nearly equalised...

Francoise comes up with a mighty fine plan.  At each lock we leave the
canoe and either one or two people to 'default' the gates and then catch
up the mother ship by paddling.  The canoe is capable of much faster
speeds than we are anyway.  I have both of the children on the roof and
we are singing songs and steering.  It's a beautiful evening and we're
stonking along.

1940 TREE!!! (CRASH)  (PW + FW have the canoe + are "defaulting" the lock
once more.) CB continues.

Oh rats... must remember to look where I'm going....

1950 Caught up by PW + FW in canoe - on with dinner!

2045 Tied up just past "old railway bridge" - past Woodford after much
motoring in the dark.

Peter sets too maing a toilet seat out of a piece of plywood for the
toilet - an old salt lick used by cattle that we found floating in the
river.  Nice.
Luckily there is lots of sandpaper or the toilet could have been an even
worse experience.  The children take it in their stride and we adults can
laugh about it.  All to bed, it'll be an early start.

8.3 miles + 3 locks
Approximately 126 miles to go, halfway tomorrow!!!
