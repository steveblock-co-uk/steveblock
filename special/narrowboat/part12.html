The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Twelve

</PRE><A NAME="Day17"><PRE>
DAY SEVENTEEN - 12/04/04 - Leaving Northampton

Kevin and Sarah had successfully joined the boat in Northampton, and now,
with all speed, we were making our way to the Grand Union.  It was late
afternoon, under a grey sky, but we were safe in the knowledge we were
over halfway, and a new section of waterway was about to be explored!  

The locks on the Northampton flight are utterly delightful.  They look
exactly how you picture locks should look - dirty, weathered bricks with
ferns and mosses growing all over them, and gnarled and careworn lock
gates with rusty winchblocks smeared with grease.  The locks are only big
enough for one boat, and that's one boat about 58 ft long.  With Cori
inside a lock there is barely any room to spare at either end and
manoevuring enough to get in, but not enough to crash became quite
important.  There is one winchblock at either end, to open the paddles
that allow water through sluices that run on either side of the gates. 
These should really be let down again so that when you arrive at a lock,
the sluice paddles are always down.

The first thing we did was hoist the canoe back onto the roof.  The locks
from here on in did not need to be defaulted in the same way that those
on the Nene had been, so it was no longer required apart from for
jollies.  I tried to show Kevin the turn and two half hitches, esential
knot for any boaty, but was getting too excited about the lock to be
particularly bothered about it.  We entered lock 17 at 1803, closed the
tiny gate (only one gate at either end on these baby locks) and faffed a
bit with the canoe, then closed the little gate and opened the flood
gates at the far end.  Cori rose like a cork.  No waiting for hours with
these littlies!  Sarah brought Kev and me a cup of tea, having been
inducted into working the gas stove, and after a brief rest we were on
our way by 1825.  We were excited by the knowledge we were going to stonk
along, and even happier about the fact we were leaving Northampton far
behind!

There was some nasty ruined building and some flats trying to look posh
on the left, and loads and loads of reed mace (what everyone thinks of as
bullrushes - but it isn't!) on the right.  The water was murky and
brownish looking, but it was a wonderful feeling to be on a new waterway. 

At 1900 we arrived at and tied up beneath lock 16.  We had to empty it
first, and then on leaving there was some blockage stopping the gate from
opening, which turned out to be a roll of fencing!  Lots of nasty litter
floating about too.  Yuck.  Still, onwards by 1920.  At 1950 we switched
off the generator and enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the batteries.
 We were now on the outskirts of a housing estate, and had decided to
press on to the furthest west curve of the flight to moor up, as he we
would be furthest away from noise and civilisation.  On the right,
skulking in the hollows of the landscape, lay Northampton, grey and
garishly lit with orange neon in the gathering dusk.  We entered Lock 15
at 2010, leaving it after ten minutes and then keeping our eyes peeled
for a likely looking tree.  At 2045 we moored up alongside the bank,
needing to use a plank to get ashore and tying our mooring ropes (rather
illegally) to two slender ash trees across the towpath.  Jolly good :o) 
The housing estate was quite well hidden by a hedge, and the noise of
traffic wasn't too loud.  

We ate a hearty dinner and then sat around the fire, playing music and
singing in the lamp light.  (Andy has three oil lamps within the boat
which certainly add to the atmosphere. However, you can only see using
the light from them if you are sitting within three inches of the
flame.... but they are very atmospheric.)  I also rang Graham, another
chap off my careership course who lived not too far from Milton Keynes,
to see if he wanted to come out and join us the next day.  All too soon
sleep overcame us and we tumbled into bed, dreaming of the adventures of
the next day.

</PRE><A NAME="Day18"><PRE>
DAY EIGHTEEN - 13/04/04 - CORI IN THE DARK

I awoke at 7.30 and peered excitedly out of the window to see if we'd
caught any unwary cyclists in our mooring lines overnight.  Sadly not.  I
boiled the kettle and roused Kev and Sarah and we quickly got ready to
leave, cast off our mooring lines from the trees and pulled the plank
inboard.  The day was glorious, warm sunshine and little to no wind.  14
more locks of the Northampton Flight lay ahead, that would bring us to
the junction with the Grand Union, and with any luck a pumpout station at
Alvechurch Marina!  Kev steered and Sarah and I sat on the roof, munching
our coissanty breakfast.  By 0820 we had moored up below Lock 14 having
to reset it before we could enter.  Cori was secured with a stern and bow
line, the stern line being a rather ropey piece of blue string that Andy
had got a job lot of.  This lock was right next to the A45, so in between
sorting out ropes and winches, I was busily waving at all the lorries and
cars going by.

Having closed the top gate, I winched open the paddles on the lower gate
to let the water out of the lock so we could enter it.  The winches have
a catch on them, so that when you have winched up the paddle, it stays
open until you have sorted your boat out and are ready to lift the catch
and gentley lower the paddles again with the winch handle.  Unfortunately
the winch catch was a bit dodgy.  The water had just started to pour out
of the lock when the catch slipped and the paddle slammed down with a
tremendous rattle and roar, cutting off the water pouring out of the lock
immediately.  This must have created a sudden vacuum in the water below
the lock, because Cori leapt forward into the space like a stung horse. 
The unexpected pressure on the lines was too much, and there was an
ominous 'crack' as the stern line parted.  Then there was a far more
ominous CRASH as Cori went headlong into the lock gates, bringing Sarah
dashing up on deck from where she had been washing up, and making me and
Kevin wince terribly.  

Sarah showed us the damage - loads of things had fallen off the two
little shelves above the stove in the galley, the force of the crash
being so strong, (and niether of the shelves having any sort of baffle to
prevent an avalanche of condiments in the event of a collision). 
Surprisingly all that had happened was that the cooking oil had spilled
everywhere, and the teapot had lost its handle.  I was expecting a
condiment catastrophe (Andy may not have any cleaning items aboard that I
didn't buy, but he makes up for this in the number of condiments he owns)
and was very relieved by such a minor incident.  A little shaky, and a
bit more careful of the winches, we continued on.

Northampton was well and truly behind us and we spotted a kestral
hovering in the green fields on either side.  The sky was the most
wonderful shade of blue and the locks were only taking ten minutes each. 
I felt filled with joy and danced and sang as we motored on.  It must
have been one of those infectious days, because Kev and Sarah were also
in very high spirits and the mood on board was very jolly indeed.  I
phone Graham again and he says he'll walk out to meet us.

0900 we reach lock 13 were 'St Kilda' is moored up at the mooring point
having breakfast.  We moor up against the bank instead and I run ahead to
sort out the lock.  Kevin brings her in beautifully and in twelve minutes
we're through.  Ahead of us looms the M1 bridge and the roar of traffic
increases.  Ahead of us we can see the flight ascending, just like in one
of those picture postcards, perfect except for the greyness of the
transport system.  

Mooring up below Lock 12, you find that you're under the M1 bridge.  I
had started a tradition of hooting as we passed under bridges to see what
the accoustics were like.  The loudness of my hoots usually depended on
whether I was on my own and whether there were many bystanders!  The M1
bridge, of every bridge we went under on the whole trip, was the very
very best.  Hooting was one thing, but singing the 'Day-O!' song
('Daylight come and me wanna go home') was much better.  I recommend a
trip underneath it if you're ever bored and happen to be travelling past
Northampton! (much better than going to Northampton anyway).  It's really
really tall and long, and is absolutely perfect for singing in.

I think by this point I'd got a touch of Spring madness.  I just remember
being absolutely and perfectly happy and excited as i dashed ahead to
open up the next lock.  Also, the winch handle at somepoint around here
became affectionately known as 'Mister Key' - christened by Sarah in
reference to a scene in the very first Blackadder
Series.(http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/8889/bladder/ba1-6.txt -
The bit with Mad Gerald near the end)

Now the locks were so close together, Sarah and I took it in turns to
dash ahead to open the next one, or stay behind and close the gate on the
last.  This meant Cori was moving continuously, rather than having to
stop and tie up all the time.  Kev stoically drove Cori in the sunshine,
and there was much fun and skipping and laughter on the shore.
0935 In lock 11
0945 Exit lock 11
0949 in lock 10
0955 Exit lock 10
0959 In lock 9
1005 Exit lock 9 - Making excellent time!

As we left lock 9, the paddle shut itself rather quickly, Sarah losing
control of the winch handle as it started to turn.  After spinning round
like a beserk Catherine Wheel, Mister Key shot off the winch, flying
through the air and landing half an inch from the canal.  Whoops!  An
exciting moment.

Sarah explained that on her only canal holiday with her family, her
father had done a very similar thing, only the half inch had been
slightly less, and the handle had disappeared into the murky depths....

1010 In lock 8
1015 Exit lock 8
1020 In lock 7 - Feels like we're aground, Sarah and me have to really
tug Cori in.
1030 Leave lock 7
1035 Into lock 6
1039 Exiting lock 6 (4 minutes flat, can we go any quicker?!)

It should be pointed out that I had a very good team and the locks were
very close together, and we were spurred on by the joy of the day.  Kev
is also something of a racing driver when behind the wheel of a car, so I
am sure he transferred some of these skills to driving the narrowboat.

1045 In lock 5
1052 Leaving lock 5
1056 Catherine takes over the helming as we enter lock 4 (much paintwork
lost)
1106 Exit lock 4
1112 Enter lock 3 (Forget to write the time of departure as we are so
carried away by the thought that we are nearly through the flight!)
1128 Enter lock 2
1138 Enter lock 1, the Top Lock, by a lovely lock keepers cottage and a
turning spot.  Many photographs taken.
1142 Exit the lock and leave the Northampton Flight.

In three hours and twenty minutes we had done 14 locks and about 3 miles.
 We were all extremely happy and excitable and looking out for Graham who
couldn't be too far away now.  As we carried on down the Northampton Arm
to the junction with the Grand union proper, we started to pass more and
more stationary narrowboats, including one with it's engines going at
full blast, obviously having some sort of service.  There was a marina on
the right hand bank, but I was too busy spotting Graham (sighted on the
left hand bank where he turned round and headed back towards a bridge)
and being excited to think about it too much until Kevin said 'Aren't we
going to stop here?'

oh yes, pumping out.  oops....

Hurriedly we came ashore on the right hand side of the river, but we'd
missed the pumpout, that was back near that boat with it's engine at full
revs.  I went ashore to find Graham and work out what we were to do.  The
marina was 'Alvechurch', very popular and busy by the look of things, and
it was really weird to be in a place I had read so much about (having
been scanning its Boat Brokerage website pages for months).  Graham
managed to climb through a hedge into the marina and we returned to the
boat.  It looked like we were going to have to go down to the Grand Union
junction and turn round, before coming back to the marina.  This was
good, as it meant the pumpout aperture was on the correct side.

We got to the junction, (nothing special, bit of an anticlimax) and I
left Kevin to execute a 180 degree turn standing on the bank with the bow
line.  Despite not ever having done a 180 turn in a narrowboat before,
and some dodgy instructions from me, Kevin managed to do the turn with
aplomb, not even needing to pole off from the opposite bank.  Off we set
again, back up the Northampton Arm.  The sky was a bit more cloudy now,
and the infectious delight of the morning had worn off a bit.  We
prepared to come alongside at the pumpout station, the boat with it's
engine at full revs ahead.  Kev was at the back steering, I was ready
with a mooring warp, and the others were at the front fending off.  We
made a bit of a meal about coming alongside, probably not helped by the
turbulance caused by the boat ahead.  Sarah, not realising how heavy
boats can be, inadvertantly got her foot between us and them and got a
very nasty scrape and crush injury on her ankle.  This calmed everything
down amazingly, and a bit tense and concerned I went to investigate
pumping out, having looked at the pump and not been able to figure out
how to work it.  Sarah sat downstairs with cold things on her ankle, Kev
disappeared crossly into the boat and I am sure Graham wondered what he
had let himself in for.

The man at Alvechurch was a curious creature with a bit of a squint who
looked rather like a gnome.  He told me rather bluntly that the pumpout
wasn't self service and was going to cost £12.  Oh, the folly of not
pumping out in Peterborough, and the cursed pumpout at Northampton!!!  I
agreed, and at the same time we filled up with diesel.  I asked about the
gas, he had lots of nice shiny bottles that looked ideal.  None of them
were CPS, indeed, he'd never heard of CPS gas.  Bum.  We decided not to
pay the extra money to switch onto these new gas bottles, and carried on,
£19.35 lighter of pocket, but also lighter of poo and with a working
toilet.  A great relief.

Sarah's ankle was rather badly bruised and she developed something of a
limp, but kept berating herself for not realising how silly she was being
for using it as a fender.  I was cross with myself for having dashed off
the night before and not given her and Kev a better talk about the
dangers of boating, like, always put something other than yourself in
between two boats because they're much much heavier than you think they
are!  Kevin was cross because he felt responsible for the muffed coming
alongside, which he wasn't.  A little grumpier than before, we set off
back towards Lock One to turn around.  By 2pm we had got ourselves
pointing in the right direction, and had picked up an old sign (found
lying flat in a hedge with no 'sign' on it) to turn into firewood. 
Graham and Kev (before we were incriminated) got on with chopping this
up, and the mood lightened somewhat.

We go past Alvechurch for the third time.  The people with the revving
engine apologise as we pass, and I feel a little better.

1422 We rech the Grand Union South and set off towards London, though in
between lies Milton Keynes and Hemel Hempstead and many many many locks. 
The map goes a bit black as you get towards London, but nevermind.  The
next peril we were going to face was the Blisworth Tunnel, third longest
tunnel on the network at 3056 yards (1.74 miles).  
Graham suddenly turns to me and says 'Have you got any lights?'

Now, if you remember, Julian was left moving Coroskeir in the dark, many
days ago on the Middle Levels to March.  At the time, he wrote 'Must rig
up nav and search light before doing this again.' because it was really
really horrid.
We hadn't.

"It's lit isn't it?"
"I don't think so, no."

We have got two very lovely nav lights, off Teal, made of brass and very
pretty.  At the moment though, they were AWOL somewhere in the engine
room and certainly not connected to anything.  
As for a light on the front.....

Ah.

I think I thought the tunnel must be lit.  
Or something.  
More likely is that I hadn't thought at all.  
That's much more common.

We moor up at Blisworth, having spotted 'Canal Craft' on the other side
of the river -  another boat yard well known from internet perusal.
Sarah and me go off to explore leaving the boys guarding the boat.  We
don't go very fast as poor Sarah is limping rather badly.  The daffodils
are all in bloom and there are dandelions everywhere and the sun has come
out again, so we feel quite optimistic as we cross the bridge.  We enter
the office and wait politely for someone to answer our plea for help. 
The older lady in overalls is talking to another woman about a boat that
is being brought through the tunnel today, should take about half and
hour apparently.  That sounds promising.  After about fifteen minutes
she's able to talk to us.

"Hello, I wondered if you could help us.  We're about to go through the
tunnel and we haven't got any lights.'

The lady looks a little surprised.  'I'll have a look, but I don't think
I've got anything...'
She disappears for a moment and then returns.  I explain that we've come
all the way from Cambridge, but we're a bit new to this whole
narrowboating malarky and hadn't really thought ahead.
'No, no I see....' she says.  "Well, turn all your lights on.  You'll
probably be alright."
We turn to leave
"Errr....Good luck!"

I am not heartened by her tone of voice.  We leave.  As we leave I see a
leaflet for novice boaties which I pick up.  It contains all sorts of
advice like 'Make sure you've got a boat with working lights' and 'Make
sure the lock winches don't slip' and 'It's very easy to go aground, so
make sure you've got a quantpole'.  Oh, the wonders of hindsight.

Outside the office we wonder what to do.  We head into Blisworth and go
to the local shop, hoping to buy, among other things, a torch.  One idea
we come up with is that we could have a small fire in the metal skillet
on the foredeck if we can't find anything else....

Once inside the shop we go up to the counter.
"Hello, do you sell torches?  We're about to go through the tunnel and we
don't have any lights."
The indian lady doesn't look like she really understands how desperate
our situation is.  "Yes, let me see, I think we do have torches...."
She hands us a bright pink flourescent childs torch.  Oh well, it's going
to be dark, it's not like anyone will see.  We buy the torch and some
batteries and all sorts of other bobbins and head back to the boat,
picking some flowers along the way. Cori has always had cut flowers on
since Andy lent her to me, and we find a 'lucky' in the hedge, a long bit
of metal that can act as a new mooring post.  It helps to distract us
from the rather frightening and enormous thought of the task ahead.  How
dark can a tunnel be?

We arrive back at the boat.  The boys have hunted about and found one
other torch, but it's a bit weak.  We put batteries into the flourescent
pink one and turn it on.  It's a very small torch....

Right.  No point hanging about.  
We cast off with our fingers crossed under batteries which are nice and
quiet.  We've been under the generator all morning.  The mouth of the
tunnel looms ahead like the throat of some enormous fish (only,
obviously, it's a tunnel).  Graham and Sarah stand at the front, armed
with our flourescent pink torch.  Kevin and I stand at the back clutching
the logbook, map and tiller.  It's 1615.

We enter the tunnel, and to begin with there is light from the entrance
guiding us on.  Every light on board is on, but it's very difficult to
see anything.  There is a faint light ahead, that must be the end. 
Doesn't look too far.....

'Right a bit!' shouts Graham from the front.
Crash

We creep along, hugging the right hand wall, although it takes Kev a few
minutes to work out exactly how to do this.  The air begins to get
colder, and all around is the menacing sound of dripping water.  The
light from inside shines faintly on the walls of the tunnel, little round
circles of light from the portholes showing aging, crumbling stone.  I
run my fingers along the walls and they come back black, covered with the
dirt of ages.  I wonder is this is soot from the first canal boats to
encounter the great darkness?

With a minimal number of bumps we continue into the gloom.  The sound of
water gets loader and louder... not dripping... more like pouring!  
Every so often down the tunnel there are well-shaft like structures up to
the surface.  The groundwater pours through these and down into the
tunnel like a cylindrical waterfall, drenching everything that travels
beneath.  There is no real light from these apertures, just a lightening
of the murk for a few seconds as you move under them.  The water
continues to drip heartily afterwards, must be a crack in the ceiling or
something....

The light we are hopefully heading for starts to get bigger, and a dark
thrumming noise begins to vibrate the air.  We realise to our
consternation it's not the end of the tunnel at all, it's another boat!

Blisworth Tunnel has no towpath, but it is wide enough for two boats to
cross, apparently.
We come to a standstill, hoping that we won't drift too far out from the
right hand wall, and wait for them to pass.
Their light gets stronger and stronger.  As they appraoch, we see
stalactites clutching onto the roof of the tunnel, and weird formations
created by salt leaching out of the walls to either side.  Sarah and
Graham are outlined against the light as the boat begins to pass us,
seeming very far away at the end of Coroskeir.

"Hello there!" I call to the couple steering the other boat.
Now boaties are usually quite friendly, but I think this couple, faced
with an obvious group of numpties who have dared to have the audacity to
take on the might of the Blisworth Blackness with only a handtorch,
decided to sneer instead.
Noses in the air they motor on, without even a wave or a raised eyebrow.
'Pompous, arrogant, conceited snobs with a big light!' I think.

On we go.  In between thinking 'My God, this is probably the silliest
thing I have ever done' I am bouncing up and down with excitement.  Kevin
is equally stoked.  "This is AMAZING!" he says, over and over.  I wish
that Andy and Julian were here.  Perhaps if they were they would have had
the know-how to rig up a light.  Suddenly I am glad they are not, this
wouldn't be half as exciting if we could see, and Andy would probably
make rude comments about my steering.

After about half an hour there is no sign of a light ahead.  There is,
however, another boat coming up behind us.  The noise of it's engines are
getting louder and louder, and although we don't mention it to each
other, we all get a feeling of being persued.  It's a bit like being in
an Indiana Jones film, moving along a dripping tunnel in the dark, not
sure of what is around us.  The air begins to feel thick with the sound
of the engine behind and gradually, gradually, the light on the front of
their boat began to pierce the gloom around us.  I have a tight feeling
in my chest and am almost quelling an urge to run ahead of this other
boat as fast as I can.

A point of light ahead!  Oh, No, it's another boat.

We slow down, wondering if this big boat with it's grand light behind us
will overtake.  They don't, but remain a respectful distance behind.  We
can hear the people on board going 'Wooohooowoooo!' every so often.  We
speed up and I decide to switch back to the generator as behind the
approaching boat is another circle of light that is definitely the end of
the tunnel.  The light from the boat behind us is now so bright that we
barely need the torch.  The approaching boat passes us.
"No lights.... You're very.....
....brave" comments the woman standing next to the man at the helm, after
a pregnant and diplomatic pause.

"Right," says Kev.  "I'm going for it!"
We accelerate.  
(Practically that means doing 2 miles and hour instead of 1.)

At 1704 we exit the tunnel into the glorious daylight on the other side. 
It's like taking a huge lungful of clean air.  Everything feels lighter,
the tight feeling disappears and I suddenly realise how totally, totally
exhausted I am from all the stresses of the morning.  That was AMAZING!
we all agree, finding ourselves in a deep gorge lined with ash trees with
lots of boats moored up along the sides.  It's taken us an hour to
navigate the great dark.  
I write in capital letters with a box round it
MUST RIG NAV AND SPOT LIGHTS B4 DOING THIS AGAIN!
in the logbook.

We are approaching Stoke Bruerne, something of a Mecca for narrowboaties
with a big museum and lots of lovely restaurants.  I don't manage to
remember the name, so it will be referred to as Stoke Bunion from now on
as that's what i called it, much to Graham's annoyance.  

The boat behind us moors up.  There's an awful lot of people on board,
and there doesn't look like there's many places to park along the canal. 
The Grand Union is much, much, much busier than any other waterway we've
encountered so far, there are boats and people everywhere!  We carry on
into Stoke Bunion and moor up at the lock, the only space available, and
something we have often done before on quieter waterways, not really
thinking it through.  Phew.  
What an afternoon.  What a day!  What a trip!!!

The boys head off to get Graham's car, drive back into Northampton and
rescue Kevin's car from Netto.  They'll park at Graham's house in
Castlethorpe, and then work out what to do about meeting back up with us.
 Sarah and me settle down, put on the kettle and try and relax.  The
blood is still singing through my veins and I feel a bit disembodied.  I
make sure the log book is up to date and check where we'll be going next
on the map.  The sun is beginning to go down, although there is still a
lot of light, it's going to be a beautiful evening.  Thank goodness we
can stop now and enjoy it!  The basin by the lock is very pretty.  The
houses are all red brick and covered in ivy, and with all of the gaily
painted boats, it is very easy to picture it a hundred years ago or more.
 The next lock is huge, able to fit in two boats easily with enormous
double gates.  They are so big there are two sets of paddles, one set on
the sluices that run into the lock, and one set on the gates themselves! 
As these are double gated locks, that's four winches to turn for each
pair of gates, although on the downhill side there are only sluice
winches and not gate sluices too.  This still means having to winch 6
separate paddles per lock, and remembering to winch them back down again.
Crumbs.

Sarah comes downstairs looking a bit worried.
"There's a woman shouting about us being here, these are the lock
moorings..."
I head up on deck.  A large and beautifully painted canal boat called
'Maderley' is approaching the lock with a rather bumptious looking crew. 
The woman is on the towpath and explains (using 'I'm talking to a numpty'
language) that the moorings we are on are the ones for the lock, and we
can't stay here because we're in the way, and that we can either turn our
boat around and moor up further up the canal, or carry on through the
lock.  She is obviously a bit cross as her boat is having to hang about
in the middle of the canal because we're on the moorings that they should
be on.  (There is a bit of space ahead of us, but I can see her point).

I think of our options.  It's 1730, the boys have just left and there's
no chance of them comig back before 6pm.  There's no way I am going to be
able to turn Cori round without an awful lot of faffing and a probable
disaster, plus, if we do turn around I am not sure that we can turn back
round again without going all the way back through the tunnel, and fun
though that was, we really don't have the time!  We can't stay here
because we're in the wrong place.  We're both absolutely knackered and
Sarah has a bad limp.
"I guess we'd better carry on through the lock."  
Sarah looks as though someone has untied her and she's starting to
deflate.  I feel exactly the same.  We've been on the move since 8am and
we're exhausted.  It's all been a bit too stressful to have to cope with
this now.

"Good." says the woman and thumps off.  'Maderley' goes into the lock
using her bow thrusters and powerful engine, as we get ready to go and
push off.  Julian had done some locks with other boats, but it's a new
experience for me.  Sarah stays on land with Mister Key to work the
paddles, and I have a mooring rope ready on the roof so that as soon as
we're in, I can climb up and help her work the lock.  I enter the lock
next to Maderley, very very aware of the space we have to occupy and very
very conscious of Maderleys very pristine paintwork.  Bumptious Woman
obviously is as well because she barks an order to Fat Son-In-Law who is
lounging about on the bow and he drops a fender over the side in between
us, probably not wanting to let our rather tatty tyre get anywhere near
their topsides.

I make a move to climb up and help Sarah with the mooring rope.
"Stay There!" barks Bumptious Woman.  "You Can Control Your Boat With The
Engine!  You Do Not Need A Rope!"
I am far too tired to argue, almost too tired to get cross, but I make a
mental note to try and leave at least one scatch on Maderley before the
lock is through.  Poor Sarah limps painfully as she pushes with all her
weight on the huge lock gates.  Luckily they are well used and not too
difficult, but I feel almost mad with frustration, stranded on Cori by
the woman's words.

There is a crinkly old man at Maderley's helm.
"What do I have to do?" I ask.  "We've always tied up at locks when there
weren't enough of us, and we're a bit new to all this."
"We guessed that before you entered the tunnel." he replies, with a
raised eyebrow.  In any other time or space I think I could probably have
quite liked him.

Bumptious Woman is standing next to someone we assume to be Overbearing
Daughter.  They are both big and butch and marching about on shore,
whizzing their winch handle round like they're Russian Shot Putters.  
"Come on weedy!" shouts Fat Son-In-Law to Sarah, who is limping carefully
between the lock gates and the winchblock.
I feel myself tense even more than I am already and wish it was possible
to run down the boat and commit an atrocity with either the tiller or
Mister Key.  How Rude!  How Dare He?!  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!

It seems to take forever.  I give Sarah a look, trying to be encouraging
despite the tyranical shadow of Maderley's crew.  We manage to get
through the lock, but I have to leave Sarah on shore as we continue on to
the next lock, not wanting to incur the wrath of the Maderley Gestapo
once again.  Once in the second lock (there are 7 in the Stoke Bunion
flight) I ask Mister Crinkly whether there is anywhere to stop as we're
both exhausted and really need a rest.  Thankfully he tells us that we
can stop after this lock as there are some moorings.  Phew.

By 1815, we've let Maderley and her crew of Fat Arrogant Nazi's disappear
off ahead, wishing flooding toilets, broken plumbing, gas leaks and
collisions upon them.  We tie up next to a Nature Reserve, (rather
worryingly called Gore Fields - perhaps earlier boaties had an encounter
with some 'Maderley's') with the sun golden on the banks and the water,
and made ourselves a much deserved hot chocolate.  What a lovely place to
stop.

My mobile rings.
"Hello, Graham here, we're at Castlethorpe, the cars are safe."
"Righto, well we've stopped, just had a horrid experience at the locks in
Stoke Bunion."
"Bruerne! Stoke Bruerne!  Anyway, we'll walk up to meet you."
"There are five huge locks and about five miles in between, you're going
to be walking for a good long time!"
"Oh well, we'll see you somewhere!"

I looked at Sarah, who looked back.  We both swigged our hot chocolate
and wearily untied Cori from this safe, secure and beautiful mooring.  
"You drive and I'll do the locks." I say.  Poor Sarah looks utterly
knackered, and although it's a bit hairaising being in the huge locks,
it's a lot less tiring than belting up and down the towpath winching for
your life with Mister Key!

1845  On we go.  I haven't made any notes in the log about the times, we
were both too tired.  The sun was busy going down and Sarah became
totally adept at not only exiting the lock through only one door, but
entering through only one door as well.  I felt extremely proud watching
her piloting Cori in the darkness, especially considering that she had
only really started driving narrowboats this morning!  

The locks were very beautiful in the half light.  I don't remember which
lock it was, but at some point we met another pirate.  As we approached
there was an odd looking gangly chap with an eyepatch and mad hair
pulling what looked like an enormous cockle shell filled with landfill. 
"'Ello there!" he shouted.  "Any good pubs up ahead?"
"Looks like there's a couple in Stoke Bunion," I replied "But we didn't
have time to stop and find out if they were good or not!"
"Do you think they sell Special Brew?"
"I think they do local beers and ales and things."
"Special Brew's local!" he shouted back, looking pleased.
It turned out he had pulled his boat all the way from Aylesbury, (we may
have an egg-whisk on the back of Cori, but he'd got an extremely
disreputable outboard that was forever cutting out) and was heading for
Shropshire to start a new job.  It had taken him two weeks to get from
Aylesbury (40 or so miles) pulling his boat most of the way, and his job
started in six weeks (two weeks? Sarah and I are not sure).  I wonder if
he made it?  He did have very badly blistered hands from the towrope for
his boat.  Interesting people on the waterways.

We carried on.  By the 7th lock I was extremely hot and even more tired,
barely able to winch the paddles open.  There was a chap sitting on the
gates and he kindly gave me a hand.  He asked where we were from, and I
recounted something of the epic so far to him.  
"Why didn't you get a tow?" he asked.  
"Why didn't I get a lorry?" I replied.

It was all so magical though, the soft deepening blue of the twilight,
the lush long grass, the peace of the countryside.  As I ran from lock to
lock, winching and pushing and pulling and winching, this poem by Yeats
kept running through my head.

Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

2040, we've just got through the lock.  Two figures appeared out of the
darkness.
"Hello!" says Kevin cheerily.
"Grumble grumble grumble!" I say uncharitably, feeling cross that they
would go and turn up at the last lock when all the work was done.
"We've just walked about ten miles!" explains Graham.  "We saw a barn
owl!"
"Grrrrrr." I say, or something along those lines.

This trip has taught me a lot about myself.  It's taught me that I am
often stupid and thoughtless, which I knew already, but it has really
brought home that sometimes it really counts to think ahead and plans
things a little bit better, because despite knowing that God is going to
put me in the right place, it helps if I help myself to get there.  
It has taught me that no matter how bright and cheery a person is, it is
very difficult to remain that way when you are tired and stressed out and
hungry and dehydrated, even when you are with very good friends and
having a really good time, whether or not it seems like it at that
moment.  
It has taught me that I am lucky enough to know some really stonking
people, who, despite me being tired, stressed out and grumpy, often
forgetful, scatty and positively dangerous at the helm of a boat, will
stand by me and help me through when I need them to.  
I feel very priviledged to know everybody who has helped out on this
trip, especially as most have them have seen me at both my best and worst
and are still speaking to me.

We carry on into the darkness.
"You know that there's a sort of unspoken rule that you don't carry on at
night?" says Graham.
Ah, that would be why we got dirty looks that night on the Nene then....
I switch to betteries that are quite well charged and we continue in near
silence.  Everyone is sitting on the roof apart from Sarah who is
cooking.  We are all drinking beer or wine.  We need it.
There are bats clicking past, and Venus shines down benignly guiding us
on.  I've had a phonecall from Julian, he's going to meet us at Newton
Regis (Newton Wotsit, I couldn't manage to remember the name of there
either), but that's still about an hour away.
On we go.

When I started my new job as Careership Warden at Hatfield Forest I used
to cycle home along a disused railway track, rather than risking life and
limb on the A120.  My bike hadn't got any lights, so the best way to
steer was to cycle staring upwards at the tree canopy, and aiming for the
gap or line of thinner leaves down the middle of the path.  Bit grim,
especially when I nearly got run down by a badger, but it seemed to work.
This was very similar.  There was even less light than when we'd gone
down the Nene in the dark, but I had gone beyond tired and was feeling
very relaxed with my wine, and there were no disasters.  It was really
good fun - Graham and Kevin seemed to enjoy it.

Finally, eventually, thankfully, we reached Newton Wotsit and tied up
just beyond a little bridge.  We moored up by tying up to a stock netting
fence with good sturdy fence posts, our lines once again going across the
towpath.  Oh well, nevermind.
It was 2155.  We had been moving constantly since 8am - 14 hours on we
had covered 21 locks and about 9 miles, as well as the Blisworth Tunnel
and numerous incidents.  I wandered up onto the road to find Julian, who
was parked just there and hopping about on his crutches getting
everything ready to come aboard.  We loaded everything on, I introduced
him to everyone, and then we had a jolly good sing and play around the
fire with dinner before settling into our very well deserved sleep.
