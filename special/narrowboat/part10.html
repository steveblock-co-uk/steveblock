The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Ten

</PRE><A NAME="Day15"><PRE>
DAY FIFTEEN 10/5/04 - WOODFORD TO WOOLASTON

Now, this part of the adventure finds us still on the Nene, heading with
all speed for the nearest pumpout station as our loo has been broken for
a couple of days, and we are surviving by using a large bucket with a
homemade wooden seat designed by Peter.  Not for the faint hearted!  It's
nearly Easter and the boat is filled with merriment, laughter and hot
crossed buns as it is crewed by me and the Wynn family.

0905  Now with lots of little Wynns aboord, the day was never going to
start quietly.  The morning begins with something of an orgy taking place
on Andy's bed in the aft cabin as both children leap on their parents and
there is much squeaking and squealing and giggling and tickling.  The
sturdiness of Andy's bed has been well tried and tested!  (And stayed
up!! - It is only two sheets of plywood propped up on a chest of drawers,
though I think Andy might have made it slightly more secure than that
from the bashing it received...)

We have an extremely homely breakfast of yummy, Francoise made Hot
Crossed Buns before getting ready to head off.  The stakes are put on
board, the generator is started with a newly rigged up 12v starter
switch, linked to the little on board domestic battery that powers the
lights while we're motoring (much, MUCH better than the pull cord, Thank
You Julian!) and we're away once more.

0925 Things aren't quite right.  We're barely moving for a start, and
when you are barely moving anyway you start to notice these things!  The
engine room is extremely fumy, glancing down there makes your eyes stream
mightily, and there's quite a brisk wind on the port side.  We collide
with the windward side on purpose while I do a prop check (a veritable
garde of weed), grease the stern tube and check the genny.

I am rather surprised to discover there is a hole in the exhaust pipe
which explains the fumes.  Where the bendy metal exhaust pipe joins the
genny has worn through due to being shaken about all the time by the
vibrations of the generator when it's operating.  I pull the pipe off,
cut through the fatigued bit with a hacksaw, and re-attatch it, now a bit
shorter.  Ben, Peter and Kate debunk to the canoe - definitely a faster
way to travel!

1030 Lower Ringstead lock - Another boat in the opposite direction!
Hurrah.  We don't have to 'default' and so get through very quickly.

1037 Out of lock! Record? YES!!

1104 Upper Ringstead lock.

1113 Out of URL, PW left with canoe. Batteries do not seem to be
charging... Need to contact Andy.

1130 Call from Mister R - have to charge batteries off power supplies
tonight + tweak voltage - sounds rather complicated.  I have a look at
the wiring and discover that the reason the batteries aren't charging is
because I am an idiot and haven't switched the charger on.  Doh.
 
1240 Into Irthlingborough lock, huge drop!

1255 Ready to go. - filled up with diesel + quick weed check - batteries
now charging!

1305 Serenade the man from 'Semper Fidelis' with John Kanaka - sung with
relish by Ben, Kate and myself.  He's busy doing something boaty and
looks very surprised when this extremely raucous narrowboat of madly
singing children chugs past.  FW is behind in the canoe, gallently
defaulting the last lock.

1320 A long, low viaduct style bridge where we almost crash into a
motorboat who is poddling through and not paying attention.  not very
funny, but we don't hit anything.  Peter decides to go back and help
Francoise who there is no sign of, so we drop him off on the shore.  I
start to teach the children the Pump-Out station song, because that is
now where we are heading with all speed!

"We're going to the pumpout station - Hooray!  Hooray!
 We're going to the pumpout station - Hooray!  Hooray!
 We've got a lot of poo on our boat.
 Not very nice when you live afloat.
 We're going to the pumpout station - Hooray!  Hooray!"

They don't really get the middle bit, but sing very loudly and like the
hooray hooray bit which is sung with much gusto.  I remember the banks
being covered with gorgeous green hawthron, almost at the point of coming
into flower.  There was that wonderful green Spring smell in the air.

1330 CB, KW & BW moor up at HIGHAM LOCK, unable to go through due to
another boat and feeling they should wait for PW&FW.  There are some very
tame ponies to look at so they go ashore armed with some bits of apple to
feed them.

1355 In HIGHAM LOCK (1/2 tank diesel)

1405 Through! A group of local 'yoof' close up the gates for us.

1416 Rejoined by intrepid canoeists :-)
     
This bit of the Nene runs alongside the A45.  I try and cause accidents
as I stand proudly at the back, waving frantically at everything that
goes past.  Nearly everyone points, several lorries hoot, some people
wave, and one car displays a very rude hand gesture to a muttered curse
from me.  I am such a tourist :o)

1540 DITCHFORD LOCK.
1555 Out of the lock with 2 boats to come in! Hurrah!
1600 Break to fill with diesel + plan plans
1620 Off again CB + BW in canoe.

Ben and me decide to Have Adventures.
First we hide behind the arch in a bridge and leap out at the narrowboat
as it chugs past.  ben really likes this game, so we paddle frantically
up the river and leap out again from behind a big willow tree.  Then we
pass a huge pile of wood on the starboard side of the river, and Peter
gestures frantically from the narrowboat for us to pick it up.  We do so,
including an immense plank we can use for boarding.

1735 CB + BW meet up once again with the mother ship at lower
wellingborough lock.
1755 Swap to batteries for a little light relief (50.1) + exit the lock.
1810 Moor up at Wellingborough to dump rubbish + use facilities.  

Wellingborough, my apologys to Kev whose uncle and aunt live there, is
horrid.  It also has a bigger swan populaion than anywhere I have ever
been.  We are ploughing through the wretched things!  The river is white!
 At least 60 swans I reckon.  The toilets are also quite unlike anything
we've ever been in.  Vile and horrid.  Advice to boaties - don't stop
there!  Even our saltlick bucket was preferable.

1820 Having visited the most disgusting toilets in Britain we continue
on.
1835 Into Upper WELLINGBOROUGH LOCK.
1850 Exit   "          "        "
1925 Enter WOOLASTON LOCK - getting greyer :-< PW leaves to get the car.
1945 Exit lock looking for somewhere to spend tonight.

Woolaston lock is in the middle of nowhere.  We are going to have to
leave the boat and head back to civiliastion as tomorrow is Easter Sunday
and we want to go to church.  The Easter service is the best one of the
whole year, and there's not one person in the congregation who doesn't
smile.  (At least I hope there isn't one person in the congregation not
smiling!)  The car is a little way away, so Francoise and I find a place
on the bank to tie up as we wait for Peter to return, having brought it
closer.  By the lock there are several boats moored, and a little house
and some willow trees and a hound of the baskervilles that barks a bit. 
Francoise packs.  I bustle about worriedly, trying to make sure when we
leave the boat, no one will be able to figure out how to make it go so it
can't be nicked.

2100  Peter returns and instructs Francoise and the children to set off
towards the car as it's a bit of a trek.  He and I are told by the man
who owns the moorings at the lock that everything will disappear as there
are gypsy folk about and they'll nick everything on the boat unless we
tie it up underneath one of his willow trees.  This costs £2.  Peter
mutters about 'thinly veiled threats'.

This means turning the boat around, or reversing up to the willow trees. 
Cori doesn't really do reverse.

Peter and I spend half and hour trying to turn the boat round.  The river
is not wide enough.  We run aground.  We edge forwards, we go backwards,
we run aground again.  We wedge ourselves firmly across the river
lengthweays at least twice.  It is now very dark and impossible to see
anything anyway.  Peter falls over something on the shore and discovers
its one of our original mooring posts.  Fed up, we tie up on the bank we
had just tried to leave, about 10 yards from where we began.

     Gypsies - please have a heart - don't steal the things that make our
     boat go...

Peter and me head back up the fields to the car.  I have locked Andy's
flashy road bike to Andy's battered cello (in it's hard case)  There's no
way even the most determind gypsy could steal either of them.  Not with
the diesel engine sitting completely in the way on the foredeck anyway! 
The wires are all disconnected in the engine room.  The small generator
on the roof is the only thing to nick, and Andy is trying to get rid of
it anyway....

Nearly half way, nearly nearly!  I am also very excited, because if
tomorrow is Easter, it means I can eat cheese and drink tea again, after
a Lenten abstinence.  Hallelujah!

DAY SIXTEEN - EASTER SUNDAY - 11/05/04
WOOLASTON TO LITTLE BILLING

The Wynns take me to church in Brentwood, after the best cup of tea I've
had in weeks (the ONLY cup of tea I've had in weeks) and some very yummy
cheese.  We then do an easter egg hunt in the garden as the easter bunny
had very carelessly dropped lots of eggs.  He threw mine into the Wynn's
nasty prickly hedge that I helped trim last summer, and it takes rather a
long time to locate it in the brambles, and even longer to extract it
with a couple of brooms without doing myself a grievous injury.  Yum Yum!

In the afternoon we head off to the boat again.  I am trying to arrange
friends to join me on Easter Monday, as francoise and Peter and katie and
Ben will be leaving in the morning.  Sarah is coming from York by train
and Kevin is driving from Keswick, but due to a bit of a muddle with work
and the time I'm meant to be having off, I need Sarah to get picked up by
Kevin so that they can both meet me in Northampton, rather than both
travelling to Stortford as was originally the plan.  Muddle muddle
muddle.
I spend most of the journey with the phone clamped to my ear putting them
in touch with each other and trying to give them a definite time and
place to meet me in Northampton the next day.  It'll mean a bit of
solo-ing in the morning.... eek!
It also means poor Kevin has to drive something of a marathon across
Britain to get us all in the right place, but bless him, he agrees
anyway.  What a hero.

Peter drops Francoise and me off at Woolaston, and with some trepidation
I approach the boat, expecting the windows to be smashed and the innards
to have been outed.
  
Obviously the gypsies have Easter Sunday off as, unsurprisingly,
everything is fine.

Peter and the children are going to park the car and we will motor on to
meet them.  Francoise isn't feeling too well, but manages to cast us off
with aplomb.  It's nearly 4pm - looooong way to go!

We pick up Peter and the children at 16.15, Francoise having just seen
the Easter Bunny climbing a tree!

1623  DODDINGTON Lock
1632  CB+BW left to default the lock, but oh no!  We're rubbish!  The
lock gates refuse to move.  PW has to leap ship and come and help while
FW+KW continue on.
1650  The canoeists join the canal boat just in time to go ahead and open
the next lock.
1700  EARL'S BARTON lock.
1710  FW+BW carry on while Katie, Catherine and Peter deal with the nasty
spinny wheel.  Oh, how I hate them!!!
1730  Canoeists once again catch up with the narrowboat, although CB has
dismally failed to learn how to paddle properly, despite not particularly
patient instruction from PW.  All are rather wet and splashed.  The genny
is spluttering and after filling it up, CB looks at the little plastic
car fan that had been bravely cooling the engine down all on it's own
since Peterborough.

The poor car fan, having been used almost constantly for the past week,
has fallen to pieces due to exhaustion.  I stick the fins back on it and
hope it will be alright.  The genny is very hot as a result of the none
working fan.  It doesn't like being hot, it grumbles and complains and
then cuts out, so we try to get things going again.

1740  Having attempted to glue the fins on with adhesive (failed) we
arrive at WHITE MILLS LOCK.  Francoise and Ben default the lock while
Peter katie and me continue.  It's getting greyer and greyer, the sky
ever darkening.  Peter breaks out the cheese (4 different types... mmmmm
thanks dad and julian for stocking up the boat for me!) and opens a
bottle of red wine.  Oh, how very decadent!

1820 we arrive at WHISTON lock, the boat covered in cheese and bread
crumbs, and me feeling very happy and full of cheese.  The air is
absolutely crawling with little black flies that cluster in dense clouds
over the lock.  As the water fills up, we slowly and majestically rise up
into them.  Yuck!  Yuck Yuck!

1835  Peter goes off on Andy's bike to sort out the car for tomorrow's
Wynn departure.  Francoise stays on the canoe to default the lock.  Me
and the children, singing once more, carry on into the gathering gloom of
the afternoon.  The children want to feed the ducks.  There is only nice
bread, so I try to dissuade them.  We run agroud rather badly at a tight
corner and they feed most of it to some swans while I am distracted by
frantically punting off.  There is a sign on the bank, pointing down a
little cut.  There are two directions, this one and another cut that
appears to go into a caravan park.  I can see the lock, and the arrow
appears to be pointing down the one in front, so on we go....

The children are singing and squawking, and I am a bit worried about them
being a bit too over-enthusiastic with the bread and throwing themselves
in to the ducks instead.  It takes me a little while therefore, to notice
the cut is getting narrower and narrower.  Eventually we are confronted
by a bridge not even the canoe could get under and realise we've gone the
wrong way.

Francoise comes paddling up behind in the canoe to help, though she
spends most of the time reprimanding us for being stupid.  She leaps
ashore, passing the canoe to us, and pulls us down the river like a horse
while I try and steer, quant and stop the children from falling in off
the roof.  Francoise throws us the rope back and heads up to the lock. 
The children are both happily sitting in the middle of the roof and I am
trying to negotiate the corner.  As we start up the cut towards the
caravan park I realise there is a hawthorn sticking out over the river,
and from the hawthorn hangs some extremely viscous looking briars, that
are now sweeping along the middle of the boat!

"Ben!  Come Here!  Now!"  I call, and Ben looks a bit shocked and
confused.  "Now, please!  Come to me now!"  I implore again, and he
shuffles forward enough that I can grab him and get him out of the way as
the big thick, heavily thorned brambles sweep closer and closer.  Katie
is looking at me with eyes round as soup plates, about to cry.  I manage
to get her to come forward just in time to grab her and duck her down
below as the briars swoosh overhead.  They catch in my hair, nearly
taking off an ear and my hair grip, pull holes in my cloths, break
glasses, nearly topple the logbook and my phone into the water and sweep
some of the bread over the side.  I pop the children, thankfully
unscathed, back onto the roof feeling a bit shaken myself, and we
continue on, singing the pumpout station song to compensate.  Little
Billing 'Aquadrome' where we are spending the night, apparently has a
pumpout station, and the toilet will soon be operational once more.

1925  COGENHALL LOCK where we drop Ben off with Francoise in the canoe,
and Katie and I continue.  It's getting properly dark now, and we want to
get to the mooring.

1945  Through the lock and on into the gloom.  I turn at a whistle and
see Peter, a small speck on the bank, being rapidly left behind.  He can
take the Wynn canoe taxi though.

1933  It's one of those amazing, magical, still evenings.  I turn the
generator off and we go under batteries for a bit, as the canoe, a bit
crowded with Peter, Francoise, Katie AND Andy's bike, comes up behind.

2020  A very tight turn through a bridge in order to get to the
aquadrome.  The river is a 'Y' shape.  Where the fork of the 'Y' is is a
bridge horizontally accross the river, with a big column, just where you
need to put the boat in order to go up the right hand fork of the 'Y'. 
Bum.  It takes a bit of too-ing and frow-ing and some mighty quanting
from Francoise to get us round.  There is a big noisy weir with quite a
strong current to the left, adn then we are under a final bridge and the
river widens into a vast lake with a fairground on the other side.  There
are some moorings right next to us on the left, and the marina somewhere
in the dark towards the fair.  I attempt to come nose on to the moorings,
but it all goes a bit pear shaped as I am listening to two sets of
instructions from peter and francoise, as well as trying to sort it out
on my own and Ben keep demanding the binoculars to look at the fair. 
After quite a lot of rather frustrated faffing, we manage to come nose on
after several groundings.  There is very little to tie up to securely,
but we tie our nose on, and then run a line out from either side to
moorning stakes.  We're not going anywhere!

2040 we are tied up, cook tea, and collapse.  the Mill Pub, next to the
mooring, is one of those nasty noisey nowhere pubs and we decide,
Francoise and children having done a quick scout, not to risk eating
there.  Very noisy music.  yuck.  We settle down for the night, safe in
the knoweldge that we are halfway home at last.
