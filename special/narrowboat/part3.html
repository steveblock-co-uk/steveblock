The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Three


The great journey begins.

</PRE><A NAME="Day5"><PRE>
DAY FIVE - 30/03/04 - WE'RE OFF!!!

Having arrived late at the boat in the dark the previous evening, I am
really happy to survey all of our hard work the next morning.  The boat
gleams, all of the beautiful new paintwork shining gloriously in the
sunshine.  It's a blissful day, shining sun, gentle breeze and the
knowledge we will be leaving today!  This knowledge is slightly marred by
the fact that Andy is deserting us and heading back to Cambridge for
nearly the whole day, leaving Julian and me to move the boat north to Ely
alone.

I should point out at this point that Andy's narrowboat has sat
stationary in Cambridge (or pretty much stationary, it has only ever
tootled up to the pump-out and back) for the last 4 years or so.  That is
why there was so much horridness underneath - it had never come out of
the water or been scraped before in it's short life (built 1998).  The
longest trip it has ever been on is the 13 miles or so that Andy covered
last Monday (22nd) bringing her up the Cam and along the Old West River
(Ouse) to Stetham lock where she has been in dry dock.  Before then her
longest trip was on a lorry from Liverpool to Cambridge... doesn't really
count.  
Julian has spent a few days on a narrowboat before, and has also done a
little bit of sailing an various peoples boats (you know who you are). 
Andy is an Ocean Yachtmaster and has had four years handling her over
short distances on the Cam, as well as crossing Biscay several times on
Morning Star and also sailing other peoples boats.  I have had a 15
minute lesson on the Cam with Andy, where I bumped the boat into a wall,
but I am a Coastal Skipper, so I suppose that might count for something.

To spell it out, we are all novices.  None of us really know anything
about the canal network, the facilities, the dangers, the trials,
tribulations and joys.  Andy is, as usual, terribly blase about the whole
thing and cycles off after an all to brief few minutes explaining in a
hurry how the rather unique propulsion system works.

Like everything on Andy's boat, which has been fitted out from scratch,
the propulsion system is rather....special.
There is an electric motor.  It needs 48 volts to run.  This is the thing
which turns the propellor.
There is a suite of eight 12 volt batteries.  These can supply 48 volts
to the motor.
There is a generator that runs on red diesel and produces 240 volts.
There are two Power Supply Units (PSU's) that can convert 240 volts into
48 volts.
There is a battery charger for taking 240 volts from the engine and
turning this into 48 volts (I think) to charge the batteries.
There is a total spaghetti of wires around the engine room, under the
floor and all over the walls that make the whole thing go.

There are two methods of running the motor.
Batteries
The batteries are connected directly to the motor, which makes it work,
the propellor turns, the boat moves.
The batteries don't make any noise, the engine makes a gentle 'whiiirrrrr
whirrrrrr' noise, a bit like a washing machine.
(Hence the line in the Andy's boat song 'Andy's engine sounds like a
washing machine, it'll only get as far as Jesus Green')
it is extremely pleasant to motor under batteries alone.  There is little
to no noise.  People smile and wave as you pass.  Andy has made at least
one person on another boat in Cambridge spill their tea by creeping up
silently beside them and then revving the engine to full 'WHIRRRR' when
they hadn't realised there was a boat there.  Lovely.

Generator
Headphones on!
The generator has to be started by a pull cord, very like a chainsaw,
because the starter battery has decided to die.  It is very hard work.  I
have to get quite cross with it before I can turn it over.
When you have started it, it makes an extremely unforgiving
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!! noise which even shouting over makes no
difference.
The generator is connected to the PSU's and the battery charger.  It
charges the batteries and allows the PSU's to give 48 volts to the motor,
making the boat go.  It is absolutely horrid compared to the batteries. 
People grimace at you from the bank.

Anyway.  In the morning, Andy disappears and Cyril, the one armed, glass
eyed pirate turns up and starts to fill up the dry dock.  I am beaming
and bouncing about and feeling terribly terribly emotional and happy
because for the first time the whole fiasco finally feels real and
happening and not just some silly dream that is all words and no action. 
Julian goes off to move his car to Ely and cycle back to Stretham.  I
rescue newts and toads out of the dry dock where they are swimming about,
rather confused.

At about noon we float the boat out of dry dock.  We run arground on the
shore and Cyril tuts and makes a note he will have to dig that bit out a
bit more.  The Environment Agency have decided to lower the river level
by 6 inches which has made everything a bit lower.  I hear this, but for
some reason it doesn't really sink in.  We pull the boat off, and then
Cyril uses his tractor to move the spare landy engine onto the foredeck,
and the crane/gantry think that was sticking out the back of the landy,
onto the roof.

12.30
Time to go.

We wave farewell to Cyril who shouts 'Straight up the middle of the river
until Ely!' at us, before giving us a cheerful wave.
We head under the road bridge...
We're off!!!!

I bounce even more.  The sun is beaming down and the fens are covered in
lush green grass that is flickering in the wind.  The wind is quite
strong, but we don't pay that any attention.  Isn't this lovely? 
Chugging along under the batteries at one with the landscape, potato
salad to munch on, free free free!!!  We're on our way!  Finally we can
start clocking off some of the 220 miles between us and Stortford.

After about two hours, in which time we only see one other boat which is
a little powerful thing with big spikes sticking out of the front that is
owned by the Environment Agency with three jolly men in who wave, we
decide it is time to swop to the generator.  The batteries need to be
charged when their output falls to about 44.  It's at 45.something, I
decide to err on the side of caution.
We slow down.  The wind blows us straight against the bank, but we're not
too worried as we have the fenders down.
We follow the instructions in my notebook.
The generator roars.
The PSU's fail to work.
We try again.
Still nothing from the PSU's.
Drat.
I try to get hold of Andy, but its 1430 and he is in his viva.  Drat drat
drat.
We sit and ponder what is going on.  Julian is an electronics person.  He
gets an ammeter out and we examine everything again.
I am completely convinced it is something really, really simple that we
haven't done right.
We faff a bit more.  The wind gets stronger.
Finally we push the lever on the generator on full so it is revving even
louder, but, ah ha! producing more volts!  The PSU's light up.  We laugh
at our stupidity and carry on.

About 3pm we get to a big corner.  The wind is now very very strong and
blows us sideways into the inside curve of the bend.  We stop.  

'Um..... I think we might be aground!'
We are.
We try going backwards.
We get off and pull the boat off backwards using a rope.
The wind suddenly gusts and Coroskier is blown sideways down the river,
becoming wedged broadside across.

"Well Done!" shouts a passer by with a camera.  I try to quell the urge
to strangle him while desperately trying to fend our beautiful new
paintwork off all the horrid bits of concrete that line this part of the
river.  

Another man comes by who is much nicer and pulls the bows forwards so we
are no longer completely blocking the river.  The Environment Agency
people chug past us towards Ely.  'Need any help?' they ask.  Pride.  Bad
emotion really. 
'No no, we're fine.  Thank you.'

We try and get round the corner again.  This time we manage it, but only
because of a lull in the wind.  There is a bridge ahead with trains going
over it.  It is very narrow.  The Environment Agency people are on the
other side watching us with slightly amused looks.  We get half way
through.  The wind suddenly smashes into us from the far side of the
bridge pushing us hard sideways against the bridge wall and into the
spikes of the Environment Agency boat!

Drat.

I am not sure whether to laugh or cry.

The Environment Agency people are obviously angels, because we are really
quite stuck this time.  They give us a tow all the way to Pope's Corner,
another half mile or so up the river where the Old West River joins the
Cam to become the Great Ouse to Ely.  The one on board our boat makes a
daring leap back onto his own vessel.  We wave goodbye shouting our
heartfelt thanks.

The Great Ouse is much much wider than the Old West River.  We steer a
rather wobbly line down the middle, blown off course on a regular basis
by the wind.

The reason the wind is such a problem is because an electric motor, quiet
and lovely as it is, only has limited horsepower.  By limited horsepower
I mean 2 and a half knots.  There is a speed limit of 4 knots on most of
the canal network.  We are the auto equivalent of a robin reliant.
The wind is much more powerful than we are, and we are really long (58ft)
giving it ample space to blow us off course.
We have rather limited reverse capabilities.  We have no sudden helpful
burst of speed to get us out of tight corners.  We have to be ultra alert
to ensure there *are* no tight corners.

However, now we are on the Great Ouse, everything seems fine.  We chat
happily about how lovely everything is again and laugh at our errors.  6
inches lower isn't that much anyway, and see how nice the Environment
Agency are, they even police their much lowered river to pull out
grounded boats!   Ely Cathedral looms large on the horizon encouraging us
along.

I lose concentration.
The wind gusts.
We are hard aground once again, only this time the shore is ten feet away
and there isn't another boat in sight.
Bugger.

We attempt to quant off with Andy's extremely heavy wind generator pole.
All that happens is it sinks lower and lower into the mud.
We are very very firmly stuck.
'Oh well, we can wait until the wind changes' says Julian brightly.
"But we're meant to be in ELY!" 
I feel terribly despondent.  It's not meant to be this difficult, it's
all meant to go smoothly so I can have boat in Stortford and be all happy
and settled somewhere I want to be.  Nobody told me that canal boat could
go aground.  For some strange reason I had it in my head that al of our
waterways were really well maintained, deep and wide and that going
aground was something that only happened on mud in the river Medway.  Oh,
how naïve I am.

Andy rings up to see how we're getting on.  I try to hide my misery under
a cheerful tone.  There's nothing he can do.
"I'll either see you in Ely or somewhere out along the river then" he
says, and rings off.
We sit for a bit longer.  A speck appears on the horizon behind us.
After a few minutes the speck becomes a boat.
We hail them.

The boat is called 'Bluebell'.  She's 30ft long with a lovely powerful
engine that goes both forwards and backwards and is about 100 times more
powerful than ours.
Daphne and Ian, her owners, are all too happy to help out this hapless
duo aground at the side of the river.  They chug into position.
"Be careful not to run aground trying to rescue us!" shouts Julian.
I blink.
Bluebell runs aground.
It's like some horrible blunders tv show.  Suddenly I am reminded of the
Golden Goose story where each person who tries to catch the golden goose
gets stuck to it, and every time someone else tries to help them, they
get stuck as well.  A mental image of the corner of the Great Ouse chock
full of narrowboats, all stuck because of my stupidity swims into my
head.

Oh no, Bluebell have got both a good engine and a light quant pole. 
They're off in no time and making their way around again.

They run aground a couple of times more before they manage to position
themselves so that the wind won't blow them onto the corner.  Their
engine gives a mighty chug, and off we pop.
We discover they'll be in Ely and wish them well, hoping to see them
later.

For a little while they chug behind us, probably expecting this fine
painted 58ft narrowboat to go steaming off into the sunset with it's fine
58ft propelling engine.  When we totally fail to do so they come past,
give us another wave and disappear into the distance.

The rest of the trip is conducted in near silence.  I am feeling very
humble and beginning to wonder what on earth I have let myself in for. 
Am I being terribly over optimistic?  Is this all a terrible mistake? 
Why didn't I just put the wretched boat on a lorry?  Is Andy going to be
terribly cross about the paintwork?  I s Andy merely going to laugh his
socks off at us, which would almost be worse?

We arrive in Ely.  I manage a perfect coming alongside outside the Cutter
Inn.  We turn off the motor, put on the kettle and take a bottle of wine
around to Bluebell who is moored up just ahead.
Daphne and Ian give us many words of comfort and advice.  They warn us
about the dangers of river meanders and assure us that the worse of this
stretch is over now.  They tell us where to buy a light quant pole from
(A banister from a DIY shop in Ely) and give us two bits of literature
about the waterways and some very helpful telephone numbers.
The horrible numb feeling of being totally rubbish goes away a bit.
