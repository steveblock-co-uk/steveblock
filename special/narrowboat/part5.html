The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Five


The days I am not onboard are a bit skwtchy, sorry!

</PRE><A NAME="Day8"><PRE>
DAY EIGHT - 2/4/04 Maintenance and Denver

Julian arrived at the Denver Sluice on the evening of the 1st April and
was joined by Andy who had been careering round the country chasing Teal,
now safely falling to pieces in Maldon.  (PLEA - If any of you have a
heart and some days to spend in late April or May helping to put a dream
together, then Andy could probably do with your help!  There is lots of
painting to do, quite aside from sorting out all of the rot!  Please help
if you can.)

The 2nd was seen as a maintenance day, seeing as they couldn't get
through the sluice till tea time.  The log records various jobs completed
- the engine system is tweaked to try and get a bit more out of it.  The
nuts and bolts (+sparks) switchover between the batteries and generator
is refined to a big clunky switch instead.  Julian oils all of the hinges
to stop them groaning, and oils and files the engine room hatch so we can
actually move it while we're chugging along instead of fighting with it
for half an hour before hitting it with a hammer.  They talk to other
boaties who are also waiting for the lock to open, and then are penalised
for being too big by having to wait an extra hour to go through the lock,
as they're too long to go through with the other smaller boats.

About 6 pm they set off, bells ring, gates open, waters equalise and they
find themselves chugging from the Great Ouse onto the Middle Levels....
our Third Waterway!  It's all terribly easy, no great tidal adventure
that I was dreading.  Thank God.

They then chug into the night, reaching the outskirts of March and
sleeping soundly.

DAY NINE - 3/4/04 March - Whittlesey

Wind a lot stronger.  As they start off, Peter appears on the bank and
jumps aboard to help out for the day.  Very very strong winds.  Much
rebounding from bank to bank.  A great shopping trip in March at the
market, many fresh vegetables (including the largest onion I've ever
seen) and mackeral, scoffed with aplomb.  Eventually having fought the
headwind for a bit longer they give up and collapse on the bank.  Peter
wobbles off against the gusts on his bike.

There is a special bit you can lift up at the back of the boat to have a
look at the propellor.  Seeing as carrying on is pointless, Andy and
Julian do some checks and unravel lots of weed and a bikini from around
the prop!  Not the sort of water I'd go skinny dipping in, that's for
sure!

Andy abandons Julian to his fate in the winds and goes cycling off to
move the landrover from Denver to Whittlesey telling Julian he'll meet
him there.  Intrepidly, despite the weather, Julian sets off alone.  It
takes a very long time.  The wind is still gusting up to a Force 6.  Not
fun.

It gets dark.

Julian, gallantly, stands alone at the helm as the boat chugs into the
darkness.
'Must fit Navigation lights and searchlight' resolves Julian, colliding
with the bank for the umpteenth time.
Late in the night Julian arrives at Whittlesey, Andy arriving not soon
before due to extremely strong headwinds that even Andy struggled with
(!).  Knackered they fall into exhausted slumber, but the boat has
covered miles, despite the wind.

04/04/04  (Great Date!)  Whittlesey - Peterborough

It's one of those peaceful mornings.  Julian can hear various 'tinkering'
noises coming from the engine room.  He thinks nothing of it and snuggles
a little deeper into his sleeping bag.  Gosh it's a bit cold to be up and
doing anything.

After about five minutes the tinkering noises haven't stopped.

Julian takes a cautious peep out of the window to discover the bank
moving past.  (I'd like to say dashing past, or thundering past, but it's
only an eggwhisk on the back so perhaps crawling past would be better). 
Andy has set off at 7.30.

They reach their first manual lock and due to the lack of lock key ('Who
needs a lock key when you have an adjustable spanner?' is Andy's policy)
take a while to go through.  They have a hunt with the boat magnet in
case some Herbert has dropped their lock key in the water.  No Herberts
today sadly.

There is another lock manned by an elderly chap with a middle aged
daughter.

It's still quite windy.  They're trying to get to Stanground Sluice by
noon.  The wind is too strong.  Andy ties the tow rope round his waist,
leaps ashore and acts as a horse for a bit.

At Stanground Sluice they get told off for not giving enough warning
about their arrival.  I get the impression that they were glad to have
triumphed against the weather.  Then Julian, dashing down the lip along
the side of the boat slips!  Oh No!  Splosh!  His feet go into the water,
his ribs impact painfully against the boat, but his fingers manage to
maintain their grip on the roof edge.

'Aaaandy!'

Andy has to momentarily leave the helm to pull him back on board, while
trying to do somesort of boat manoevure.  Julian is unscathed apart from
aching ribs and wet feet.  

Once moored up at Peterborough, Andy takes all of the best tools and
makes his way back to Whittlesey by bicycle to meet up with the landy and
then head off to do work on Teal.  It's nearly dark, so he takes night
lights to heat the boat with, there being no facilities on board.  Julian
heads off to Ely to rescue his car and rescues me from Cambridge on the
way.

We spend about an hour driving round and round Cambridge trying to
escape!  Finally we find the right road and head out to the boat.  There
is a fabulous moon.  We try to sort out some sort of parking in
Peterborough, but it's too late and we duck into a car park and pay the
£1 over night charge.  I'll have to get up early and get a new ticket for
the morning.   The moon traces a silver path down to Cori, nestling
against the bank by the pumpout station.  There are lots of spare
daffodils in the park we walk through to get to her, so I pinch some. 
They've nearly finished anyway.

Andy, bless his holey cotton socks, has moved out of the back room, so
now I have my own proper bedroom on board.  I am sure you can imagine how
pleased and excited I am by this.  Very very glad to be back, not even
really feeling scared anymore, more full of anticipation and resolve to
get somewhere.  I bounce a lot.  Julian is very pleased I'm back.  We
cook tea and wait for our third travelling companion, my father, to
arrive.

Dad and me have a chequered history, but he is very excited by the boat
thing and wanted to help, and it seemed mean not to let him.  He arrives
very late in the night with several bottles of wine which he is terribly
protective of.  We eat lots of vegetables and drink lots of wine.  Then
we move the boat about a hundred yards up the river to get away from the
nasty poundy factory on the opposite bank.  The moonlight is totally
amazing and makes all these beautiful reflections on the windows.  

Exhausted, Julian swops beds to the futon, and Dad takes the front room. 
I bounce to the back and curl up looking out at the moon on the water
from my bedroom.  Very content, very happy, very tired!

DAY TEN 05/04/04 Peterborough - into the darkness

I awake at some terribly early hour to go and sort out the car parking. 
It's really really beautiful early Spring morning light and I saunter
proudly through the park, although there's no one to see me, thinking 'My
boat!  my boat!' and doing a little jig every few paces.  I see a woman
with a dog on the front basket of her bicycle and wave.  She doesn't wave
back.  Misery.  Bounce back to the boat.  Bounce a bit more.  Back to
sleep.

A bit more of a sociable time we awake properly and organise ourselves. 
Dad and Julian head off in their cars to Yardwell, a town about 12 miles
away on the Nene where my friend Emma lives.  She really wants to help us
and I rather ambitiously say we'll be there by lunchtime.  Dad and Julian
have bikes with them.  They'll drop the cars and then cycle back to Cori.
 I go shopping.  We need a fan for the boat, and some candles and other
sundries and things.  I also start hunting for a new mobile that will do
infra red and clever internet things so I can connect it to the palm
thing I am going to have once I am boat bound in Stortford.  I need lots
of ID.  I don't have any.  Bum.

11am.  No sign of Dad or Julian, but they didn't leave very long ago.  I
wander in and out of shops trying not to buy books.  I get in touch with
Becky, a friend from Uni who randomly is arriving in Peterborough.  I
thought she was getting in at 10, but she's late.  More like 1pm, well,
we'll be gone by then, sorry.

More aimless wandering.  I go to look at the cathedral.  They won't let
me play the piano the rotters.  Very lovely though, but not as nice as
York Minster.

12.30pm  Perhaps I will be about for Becky after all.  Start walking to
the station in the rain.  Call from Dad and Julian, they got terribly
bogged down in the mud and had to resort to going back to the cars and
driving one of them back to Peterborough, they're about 20 minutes away
or so.

1pm I meet Becky, or thereabouts, all rather random, I haven't seen her
for years.  She hasn't changed a bit!  We head back to the boat.

2pm.  Lunch with Dad and Julian.  Where is all of the time going?  I have
already spoken to Emma and said we'll be there for dinner.  Hmmmmm not
hopeful!

3pm Becky leaves.  It starts to rain.  We decide we really orght to set
off!
