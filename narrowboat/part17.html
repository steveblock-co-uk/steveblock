The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Seventeen

</PRE><A NAME="Day24"><PRE>
Day Twenty Four - Southerly Strippers Alive Alive-O!

Now I have to apologise for the end of this day in advance, because it
gave me a bit of a surprise, and it will surprise you also, so I'm just
warning you now.  It has something to do with the title of this day.  I
shall leave the rest to you.  No!  Don't skip ahead and read it first!

Anyway.
Julian is now the only person involved in the boat move who is able to
give up his time to it.  I am ensconsed at work, and am also trying to
pack for my imminent housemove onto Cori.  I have managed to persuade my
father, who had such an excellent time on the previous part of the trip
on the Nene, that he really wants to help Julian move her further south,
and bless his hat, he has decided to do so.

1130  Julian arrives at Widewater Lock, Denham, with food supplies.  It
is not raining (as it was when julian and I made our sorrowful way there
two days previously) and he soon has the boat pointing in the right
direction and ready to go.

1315  My father arrives, probably carrying many bottles of wine, some
fruit and some more wine, just to be on the safe side.
1340  Julian and Dad enter the lock and start back on the journey.
1350  Exit lock and enter Harefield Marina where they pumpout, get
water, and fill up our gerry cans with diesel.
1445  Exit the marina and moor up opposite.  Do a bit of car swopping so
that cars will be in the right place later.  (Closer to Denham station)
1538  Finally set off
1615  Denham Deep Lock, 11 feet, 1 inch, our biggest drop/lock yet!
1630  Exit
1640  Batteries totally flat.  Switch to generator (URGH).  The
generator is made even more horrid as the exhaust has broken again and
is so pumping disgusting acrid black fumey smoke into the engine room. 
It makes your eyes burn and your throat sting and your head ache and is
very reminiscent of the Chemical Workers Song - 'There's thunder all
around me and poison in the air, a lousy smell that smacks of hell and
dust all in me hair'.  Very nasty indeed.

1655  Uxbridge Lock
1700  Exit.  There are loads of boats having some sort of regatta thing.
Julian takes pictures, especially as Anne and John (on an unamed boat
who has been accompanying them through the last two locks) are taking
part in it.
1750  Cawley Lock
1758  Exit
1802  A little excitment as Dad's hat blows off!  Julian reverses, the
pole is ready to grab it, tension is high, beath is bated and the hat
sinks without trace, leaving fathers pate open to therigours of the
weather.
1910  Refill the generator.  It was empty and Julian has made a note in
the log about learning how to bleed it, just in case we run it properly
dry one day.  As far as I know, we still don't know how to do this.  Any
suggestions?

1940  Moor up just before Dawley Bridge in Hayes Town.
1955  Stop the generator.  the batteries are not happy and barely
charging and refuse to charge fully.  Not a good sign, but they have
received something of a battering over the pat two weeks.

Julian and Dad prepare dinner and probably have a bottle of wine.  Or
two.  Then they decide to o to the pub having spotted a likely one down
the river.
I am at home in Stortford, cursing my luck that I have a wonderful
outdoors job that demands I do it rather than move Coroskeir around the
country.  I try to ring Julian to find out where they are.  no answer. 
Most likely destination - the pub.  i leave a message on both phones
asking them to give me a ring and let me know their progress as I am
curious as to where they are and whether there have been any more
accidents.  I go to bed.

0049  'BRRRRRIIIIIIINGGGGGGGG!'
I sit up with a deep sleep hnurgh?! and try to work out why my alarm is
going off in the dark.  It takes a good few seconds to work out it's my
phone.
"Ugnr... Hello?"
There is the rather confused sound of People Outside on the other end,
as though whoever is phoning me is outdoors.  I think I can hear my
father giggling rather drunkenly in the background.
"Hello!  It's Julian!  We've just been to an excellent pub!  With
strippers!  We gave them money and they took all their clothes off! 
Wow!"
There is something rather surreal about sitting in your bedroom, which
is full of half packed boxes, in the middle of the night, woken from
deep sleep, having someone you never thought would say the word
'Strippers' babbling away about it, especially when your father is
involved.
"That's nice.  Did you get very far today?"
"Oh a bit, but it was an excellent pub!  They just took their clothes
off.  Lots!  A fantastic first time experience for us both!"
"Yes yes, very nice, I'm going to sleep now.  Bye."

Maybe I should have been a little bit nicer, they had obviously had an
excellent evening.

DAY TWENTY FIVE - Exhausted in London Town

0738  Julian and dad, unable to see a clock, unwittingly arise much
earlier than they were intending after their drunken escapades of the
night before.  Oh well :o)  They have a leisurely breakfast, clean out
the drinks and cereal cupboard and then recycle a baked beans can in an
attempt to mend the exhaust pipe with it.  Julian recommends various
ways of fixing it with different materials in the log book, but decides
that the best thing would really be a new pipe.

1045  After a bit of DIY they cast off heading East towards London! 
Finally we are travelling towards Stortford rather than south of it or
north of it or west of it.  It's only taken about 170 miles....
1057  Under 'Anchor Bridge'
1125  Moor up to shop at the Paddington Arm Junction.  Cori is now well
and truly within London and about to start down the Regent's Canal.
1229  Head through the Bulls Bridge Junction and onto the Paddington Arm
of the Regents Canal.  No locks for miles and miles!
1310  Stop at various large DIY and exhaust shops.  There is no suitable
pipe to replace it with, various things are bought to doctor the current
problem.
1400  Despite being patched up, the exhaust is still leaking and not
happy.
1410  Try to reattach flexible pipe to outflow point in the hull using
newly purchased U bolt.
1430  Eat kippers.  Aplly exhaust repair putty.  

Wait.  
Eat Lunch.  

Wait a bit more.  
Eat dinner.

2010  Set off under extremely flat battery (and therefore painfully
slowly) to find better mooring for the night.
2025 Stop by school playing fields.

There is much talk of hiking back down the towpath and trying to find
the Woolpack, (the pub with the strippers in) but apparently it is too
muddy to try.  And both are feeling their pennies in their pockets as it
was apparently quite a pricey experience.  (No matter how fun....)

DAY TWENTY SIX - Skippers return and a lesson in speed

0720  Alarm goes off, this time intentionally for an early start. 
Bright sunshine!  Julian gets up eagerly.
0740  Stern tube greased, inspection hatch checked (clear) and generator
started.
0745  Set off.  julian now feels extremely smug.  Way back on the Middle
Levels, Andy managed to get up very early and set off before Julian had
even considered opening an eyelid.  Julian spent the day feeling a bit
miffed that he hadn't realised and got up earlier, and now he has
managed to do exactly the same thing to my Dad!  What a triumph.
"That's the first time I've done that smug early-start trick, and it
feels good"  muhahahaha

0750  Unable to contain his glee, Julian dashes below to get milk, bowls
and cereal, and tell Dad they're up and running already.... tee hee hee

0751  Run down again to grab a spoon and eat breakfast in the bright
morning sun on the roof, basking in smugness.

0756  (Accompanied by very lovely sketch)  'Pass lovely moorning place
along a park by an elegant footbridge.  I'm glad the first half hour of
this noisy racket is in non-residential areas'  (Still quiet enough not
to wake my father up..... ;o)

0840  Comments on the charging capacity of the batteries.  Julian
estimates it will need 10 hours of charging to be at full whack.  Dad
cooks kippers.  "Nice to smell and taste," writes Julian.  "But we had
some yesterday and they are very full of bones."  I don't know.

0930  Julian triumphantly takes his shirt off to bask in the baking sun,
cooled by a gentle breeze and wolf whistled at by builders.
0955  Dad takes the helm while Julian retreats below to sort out the
generator and try and get the batteries charging better.  (But more
likely was going to hide from the prying eyes of the workmen.)  A very
elderly lady with a pronounced limp and a hump, weighed down with many
heavy shopping bags, shuffles painfully on her way along the river bank
somewhere behind Cori.

1022  The old lady, walking slower than most snails, disappears into the
distance ahead.  My father gives an exasperated snort at the speed of
Coroskeir's engine and mutters about getting a nasty smelly, efficient,
powerful diesel one instead.

1045  Julian decides to try and charge the batteries through the power
supply units rather than through the charger.

1235  Refill the generator again.

1320  Little Venice Junction, a very scenic and pretty boaty place
apparently, but I haven't seen it, so I can't describe it to you.
1330  Pull into a space that isn't really big enough to await Andy's
triumphant return to Coroskeir after various wooden boat palavers in
Maldon.*
1332  Andy arrives.  The intrepid trio set off into the great dark of
Maida Hill Tunnel.  (Only 272 yards long rather than the 3056 yards of
Blisworth.)
Now, this time we have finally learnt a lesson.  Julian has spent
several evenings creating an extremely elaborate light which he clamps
to the front to guide the way.  Andy snorts derisively (and later takes
it to pieces exclaiming 'totally over engineered' - the rotter) but
leves it on, none of the blisworth bashings for this lot!

1430  Hampstead Road Locks, the first for 26 miles!  Julian finds this
out after asking an interested pedestrian.  Turns out he's the keeper of
limehouse lock where Cori is headed for.
1450  Camden Lock.  Not stopping overnight anywhere near Camden is one
of the only peices of advice we were given before departing.  it is easy
to see why.  Crowds of gawping day trippers line the banks.  Andy throws
gingerbread men to teenage girls that strew the canal banks, as if
throwing fish to penguins at the zoo.  He doesn't do anyone any damage
(sadly) and they manage to miss most of the biscuits (a terrible waste)
and leave them lying on the banks.  "They were asking for it" says Andy
when questioned.
1510  Exit Kentish Town Lock
1530  St Pancr(e)as Lock having scoffed plates of turkey, rice
vegetables and bread.
1542  Exit
1600  Islington Tunnel (960 yards, a little more respectable)
1613  Exit tunnel
1618  City Road Lock
1623 Exit
1630  Back to generator (groan)
1634  Sturts Lock
1720  Actons Lock.  The generator is occasionally cutting out
completely.
1728  Exit
1750  Old Ford Lock.  This lock has such leaky upper gates tht " there
is almost as much water gushing over the gate at our stern as was
flowing over the weir/lock combinations on the Nene" (a point at which i
used to gt quite panicy in case we ended up underneath them and sunk)
"At least the gates on the Nene were designed for that!"

1805  Spot a cut on the left hand side of the canal saying 'Welcome to
the Hertford Union Canal (Ducketts Cut)'  Andy is fiddling with the
Power Supplies and the generator at the time.  the map is called for,
there is much pouring and it is discovered that the cut is desired
route.  A bit of faffing and reversing and turning round ensues.  The
water of the Gertfordshire cut is very clear, the stones and weeds can
be seen on the bottom, and thankfully there isn't much rubbish.

1810  My father heaves his rucksack, shares manly handshakes and
disappears into the gathering dusk to find a tube station.  He has
managed to do about a sixth of the trip all told and has certainly
earned himself a place in the epic.  Thank you Dad, I think you ended up
enjoying it, despite being too cold and not bringing enough socks,
sweaters or sleeping bags!

1930  Exit Hertford Union bottom lock.  Propellor inspection reveals
many plastic bags intwined.  generator off and Cori drifts while A and J
cut them free and await Gillian and Matthew, Andy's cousins.
1945  Gillian and Matthew board.
2020  Nearly run down by a rowing 8 team.  "Should that be there?" asks
Gillian as they come storming up towards Cori's stern.  Ten feet away
and the cox eventually sees the hull of the looming narrowboat and they
screech to a halt.

2113  Moored up on Walthamstow Marshes after much cleaning of weeds from
the prop.
2130  Dinner of cod, vegetables, rice and red red wine.

Coroskeir has now reached the River Lee, meaning it really isn't all
that far home to Stortford (the train journey to Walthamstow takes about
30 minutes or so).  When I hear how near they are in a phonecall to
Julian that evening, I can't quite believe it.  they've done London in 2
days!  I had got all my London friends keyed up to go and join in, but
they were through so fast there was no time for anyone else to hop on
board!  It will only be a matter of hours now and she'll be in
Stortford, just a few hours after all of those weeks of planning and
travelling and breaking and motoring and eating and singing and
panicking and revelling.

I ring up Dudley, the man whose moorings I am hopefully going to be
living on.
"We should be arriving in two days time...."
