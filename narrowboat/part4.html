The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Four

</PRE><A NAME="Day6"><PRE>
DAY SIX - 31/3/04   Ely-Littleport

There is a gentle plashing of a duck swimming along somewhere near the
boat.  Somewhere close by a train whistles through bound for Kings Lynn. 
I open my eyes to the rippling light patterns of the water reflected on
the ceiling.... feels like months since I've seen that, first time since
we left dry dock anyway.  The boat rocks gently as someone motors past.

BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!

Andy's alarm shatters the calm and heralds a day full of new boat
adventures.

Having tied up at Ely last night, Julian and I pottered about a bit,
orientating ourselves with one of the smallest cities in England.  The
cathedral dominates everything, but we've missed morning prayers and it's
at least a fiver to go round it...maybe on the return journey next year. 
Andy returned (now 'Dr' Rankin) and we had a lesson in wiring in the
engine room, installing the battery that he and I used to run the landy
before we got the new one.  This now means that there is a 12 volt supply
while we're motoring, which there hadn't been previously.  This also
means that we can get water out of the taps, use the stereo/lights, etc. 
The newly installed battery is charged via the 4 solar panals on the roof
and is a separate system to the one running the motor.

Andy is once again dashing off.  The reason I am borrowing the narrowboat
in the first place is that he has come up with the plan to spend the
summer cruising around the Baltic.  The boat he has chosen to do this in
is a small (21ft) wooden gentlemans yacht named Teal, which has been
located on Alderney in the Scilly Isles for the past few years.  She
isn't a very happy boat, being rotten in both the stern and the stem. 
Her spars appear fine but will need an awful lot of TLC to get them
going.  Andy has some plans for ripping out the innards and starting
again.  At least she has no engine, so that's one less thing to worry
about, although if she needed one I guess there is the one currently
lounging on Coroskier's foredeck....
Andy is going to oversee the loading of Teal onto a lorry, somewhere near
Portland, Dorset.  She is then being transported to Maldon, Essex, where
Andy is going tomorrow to see her off the lorry, before he returns to the
boat for a few days.  Then he's going sailing on Morning Star and the
Broads for two weeks, so Julian and I are going to have to fend for
ourselves.  Luckily Julian is spending the next five days on Coroskier,
if not more, and tomorrow he will be going it alone as I am at work and
Andy is somewhere in the UK.  He, at least, will have some clue what to
do in Andy's absence.

Anyway.  Andy leaves, having given us a shopping list including fenders,
5 Amp fuses, diesel and a quant pole.  The Bluebell couple, bless them,
have told us where they bought theirs, a DIY shop in Ely.  Julian and I,
after a rather lazy and unfocused start, head off into Ely to comply. 
The first thing we do is buy the quant pole.  It's 3m long and is really
meant to be a bannister for some land-locked stairs.  Hah, a far more
exciting future awaits it!  The scene that follows is something out of a
Laurel and Hardy film as we walk through Ely trying not to bop
pedestrians on the head with the pole.  I take it to the library to write
up our adventures while julian goes to the chandlers.  The library
charges money to check e-mail!  Shocking.  I have to return to the boat
to get some.  As far as I know there are no casulties, but I get a lot of
funny looks.

I am feeling a bit odd today.  Excited, yes, well, I'm always excited,
but it is marred by a feeling of unease.  The funny feelings of yesterday
haven't quite subsided.  She's a fabulous boat in her way.  There have
been many afternoons over the years of working on her that I've sat by
the stove, gazing out of the window at Midsummer Common and dreaming of
owning her and taking her on the river.  I take great pride in her now,
but I think that's part of the problem.  I'm afraid.  I'm very afraid of
doing something stupid.

The sun comes out from behind a cloud.  I try to shrug off the feeling,
put the quant pole on board, and head back into town.

I meet Julian in the chandlers where he is buying boat bits.  We buy some
guides to the Middle Levels and the Nene.  I feel slightly more prepared
if I've read something about where we're going, even if it's no help at
all!  We walk out of the shop with the fenders slung around my neck and
Julian trying not to look too embarressed, especially when I have a
hopeful look inside a skip to see if there's any wood we can filch for
the stove.  Julian did this himself, but it was under the cover of
darkness, not broad daylight...

Finally we have finished our errands, and now have a Log Book to fill in
for Coroskier - very important.  I am still reluctant to leave.  I am
feeling very nervous of the tiller.  Daft really.

Finally I pull myself together and we head off to get diesel from the
other side of the river.  The patrons of 'The Cutter Inn', basking in the
sunshine, watch our departure with interest.  Nothing goes wrong.  Julian
brings us very nicely alongside the pontoon.  We fill our diesel tanks
and dump all of the paint tins and rollers from the dry dock so they
aren't cluttering up the foredeck (or at least mean the engine clutters
up the foredeck a little less).  It's roasting hot.  I put on my shorts
and take off lots of layers.
Then we head back across the river to the pump-out station.
Andy's boat has a holding tank - that is, a big box for poo.  It lives
under the toilet and can be happily forgotten about for approximately 6
weeks before you have to start thinking about emptying it.  We are
thinking of emptying it now.  On all the waterways there are pumpout
points where you stick a big hosepipe into the tank, suck out all of the
nasties without having to even get your hands dirty, and live in the
knowledge that they are going straight into the town sewer system to be
dealt with properly.

The only occasions I have pumped out with Andy, something has gone wrong
and the boat has filled up with sewage.

We read Andy's instructions a couple of times, and open up the pump out
station with the special key.  We remove the two caps on the side of the
boat, one for the hose to go down, and one, I assume, is a vent.  We
stick the hose firmly into the pump-out hole.  We press the big green
button marked 'Start' on the pump out station wall.  
"Yummmner, Yummmner, Yummner" sings the pump.
After a minute we open the valve on the hose and the tone of the pump
changes to a more eager and enthusiastic 'YUMNer YUMNer YUMNer".  Yuck.
We have a faff trying to sort out Andy's funny fabric wind up hose pipe,
but manage to fill up with water at the same time.  (Different hole...)
After the hose turns itself off, having cleverly worked out that it's
finished, Julian goes below and pumps the toilet 200 times to flush the
tank with fresh water.  We repeat the pump and water procedure a couple
of times to be sure everything is clean and nice.
No disasters.
No boat filled with poo.
'Just be careful that valve doesn't open when you're putting it away'
says Julian sensibly.
I blithely wind up the hose.  The valve hits the floor.  I shriek, leap
away, and then recover my composure, leap forwards and turn it off again.
 No great gushing fountains of effluent, just a little dribble that needs
sluicing away.

Our friendly Environment Agency angel chugs by "You going up to Denver?"
he asks.  "See you there!"  Nice to know we can be rescued if
necessary....  

We write up the log book.  I give myself a firm shake and tell myself not
to be stupid, not to be scared.  Everything is going to be alright, the
worst is over, just stay in the middle of the river.
"Julian, do you want to steer?"
Julian is always happiest when he's doing something.  He loves steering. 
He takes the helm willingly, not realising my ulterior motive.

Once again, Julian takes the boat off beautifully and we start our
journey north.  The river goes underneath the railway bridge.  There is a
train, so I jump up and down on the roof and wave a lot.  He toots the
horn and waves back.  There are lots of pedestrians walking alongside the
river (no doubt they've come out now they know there isn't a nutter
walking around Ely with a three metre length of pine) I wave at them too.
 The less short sighted ones wave back.  The river follows the road, so I
spend most of the trip running up and down the boat waving at cars when
I'm not cleaning the floors, or the roof, or the solar panals.  Julian
steers benignly.  We munch gingerbread men.  Everything is fine.  (There
are no bends or meanders...)

After a while we switch over from the batteries to the generator.  Julian
begins to get worried about the Power Supply Units, which are totally
failing to give any reading on their ammeters at all.  They orght to be
reading something "Can you steer for a bit?"
I don't really want to, what if I do something silly?
The helm is thrust at me while Julian goes below into the engine room
wearing his 'I'm going to sort this problem out' face.  I look ahead. 
The river is straight.  There are no bends.  Unless I am totally, totally
moronic, nothing can go wrong.  I hope I am not totally totally moronic
today.

Every so often Julian pops his head up and explains something about the
voltage shorting out or the broken ammeter needles, or just to escape
from the all consuming roar of the generator, shaking itself to bits
somewhere behind his left ear.  He has resorted to earplugs - luckily
they're his and not Andy's totally skanky ones.  I nod back, getting
about half of what he is saying, but trying to concentrate on not being
totally totally moronic.  There are a couple of wild swings in our wake,
but nothing too serious.  We turn the motor down a little so that the one
PSU isn't shorting out all the time, this seems to make Julian a lot
happier.

All too soon there is a village in the distance.  We swop to batteries
again so Julian can try and figure out the problem without the generator
butting in all the time.  We come to rest outside 'The Black Horse' pub,
and while I wait for my train, clean the windows.  Julian decides to
consult Andy about the ammeter problem, and is getting more and more
excited about the prospect of Coroskier being 'My Boat Now!' as he hops
from foot to foot :o)  I give him a goodbye hug, and wish him all the
best and safe journey about 300 times.

I am in an odd mood.  I don't want to leave.  A day with no disasters has
cheered me up a lot and I am not quite so apprehensive about the journey,
but there is still 200 miles or so to go.  There is the hopelessly windy
River Nene.  There are hundreds of locks.  There's the third longest
tunnel on the network in England.  We have only managed 5 miles today,
palaver free, but only five miles.  It's still a very long way.  

I pull Leopold, my battered and broken mountain bike, off the roof and
wobble off to the station.  It's rather depressing that my journey home
to Stortford takes about 90 minutes, especially when it's going to take
us the best part of a month, if not more....

DAY SEVEN - 1/4/04 To Denver!

Now, this is written from Julians account of yesterday, a rather hasty
telephone conversation.

Having seen me off, Julian took the boat another couple of miles up the
river for the evening.  There were no incidents of note, apart from him
realising, as I did, that Littleport was much bigger than we thought, and
that the station was a ten minute cycle ride from where he had dropped
me, rather than the 1 minute one we thought it was.  Oh well.  

The next morning he awoke to an onshore breeze.  This meant that the
narrowboat was being pushed onto the shore and it wasn't very easy to get
it off alone.  Valiently he attempted pushing off the bows, then running
to the back, leaping on, and revving the engine.
Of course, our engine is about as powerful as an eggwhisk, so by the time
it had got itself into action, the bows had blown back on and Coroskier
had moored herself again.
Julian resorted to having the engine on full blast and pushing off from
halfway down the boat with the quant pole.  Success!  Relieved, he set
off north, having made sure everything he needed was at the back end of
the boat so he could get at it easily.

He had an excellent day and made fantastic progress, arriving at Denver
Sluice, the doorway to the Middle Levels and a rather interesting bit of
tidal river, at about 4pm.  Here he made sure that Coroskier would be
going through the next day (although not until tea time due to tides) and
then went to the pub with Andy, who had come back from traversing England
and sorting out Teal.  He sounded in very high spirits and they have
sorted out the engine so that it goes a bit faster.

Andy had assumed we would rather wreck all of his carefully arranged
instruments, and so had not overclocked the instruments to give us more
power.  I had not wanted to wreck them in the first place, and so had
erred on the side of caution a little too much, seeing as he had given us
very lenient markers for when to switch things off.  (But we didn't know
they were lenient markers).  This is the reason we didn't over rev the
generator on the first day and spent 90 minutes trying to figure out why
there was no power.  This is why we had changed over from the batteries
at 46 volts, rather than waiting for them to drop to 40 as he is now
saying was acceptable.  Nevermind.  Everything will work now, we might
even have enough power to outdo the wind on corners.
