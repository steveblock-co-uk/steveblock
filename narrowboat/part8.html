The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Eight

</PRE><A NAME="Day11"><PRE>
DAY ELEVEN CONTINUED 6/04/04 - FAREWELL TO THE BOAT

Having now managed to get ourselves onto the moorings by Elton lock
without any more accidents, Emma and I set off on a jaunt into Elton to
find a pub.  We find two pubs, the Crown, very pretty and rural, and the
Black Horse, looks nice and it says that they do teas...

They're lying.
 
Both pubs are shut, so we go to the village shop and buy supplies for the
boat instead, and then bang into Dad and Julian who were trying to meet
us at one of the closed pubs, seeing as they had no idea how to get to
the boat.

It's about lunchtime, and Elton is a particularly pretty sleepy little
village.  We drive slowly through and end up parking under a terribly
un-English Horse Chestnut (nasty foreign non-native tree dontcha know)
and stolling down the 200 yards or so dirt track to the boat.  I think we
had some lunch and faffed, can't really remember.  However, at some point
we realise that we need to be in Peterborough by 5pm as Emma has a
dentist appointment, and it's now 4.30pm.  Panic!

I get the bike off the boat and shout a lot whilst trying to pack.  Dad
is terribly slow and laid back as usual, which makes me even crosser and
more bossy.  Julian has his usual expression of calm endurance, and Emma
is grinning the way I remember her smiling on Tall Ships when everything
was in absolute chaos and there were waterspouts on the horizon!  We dash
to the cars.  Oh drat!  I have been a stupid moose and left my phone
charger on the boat.  I attempt to run back, but I am terribly unfit, not
that it matters, Julian and Dad are having a lengthy discussion about how
to attach the bike to the roof rack, so we're not going to be going
anywhere fast!

Eventually the bike, Dad, Julian, me and Emma are loaded into the car and
we speed off towards Peterborough, nearly taking a tree out on the green
as we go.  Peterborough is in turmoil due to a very bad crash and it has
started to absolutely pour with rain.  In the heat of the madness we
throw Emma out of the car, and she dashes off to go to the dentists while
we sit stationary in the traffic waiting to get to the station and trying
to recover our composure.  Julian and Dad drop me off, and then return to
the boat where they charge the batteries off the genny for abit and then
go to 'The Crown' for drinks.

DAY TWELVE 7/4/04 - A GUSTY DAY ON THE NENE

Dad and Julian, left to their own devices, arise at 8.30 ish and are off
by 8.50.  They arrive at Warrington Lock at 9.30 and attempt to pull the
boat onto the moorings, seeing as they have decided they are very very
bad at doing it under power.  It turns out they are even worse at doing
it manually, but nevermind.
At 1015 they set off from the lock, having checked the prop and the
engine.

At 1045 they reach Fotheringhay.  Fotheringhay is hailed as one of the
prettiest towns you will ever find on a river.  Sdly I missed it, so I
can't give you a full description, but there is a very nice sketch in the
log book by my Dad of what I think is a church.  Fortheringhay is where
Mary Queen of Scots had her head lopped off, and Dad and Julian go and
stand on the mound and go 'Oooooooh' before getting back on board and
continuing.

By 1115 they realise the genny is completely failing to charge the
batteries and so moor up to sort out the problem.
There is a loose wire!
They discover this after about an hour of exploring all of the dark holes
and bits of spaghetti around the genny and the power supplies.  It is
successfully re-crimped and reattached and found to be "Tested and
working, Jolly Good" (in Julian's words).
Over lunch they charge the batteries a bit and set off at 1315.

1340 is Perio lock.  By 1410 the genny and the charger are still running,
but only at 3 Amps of charge.  Apparently "That won't go far" (I really
still have no idea about the whole battery charging system apart from how
to make it go, but nevermind....)
At 1435 the gallent crew are beset by a vile hail storm which makes them
very cross and very wet.
1445 the hail stops and the sun comes out again.  Dratted, schizophrenic
April!

1447 - Cotterstocks Lock, exited at 1525.
There are more squalls of hail after this.  The set their faces to the
wind, and I have no doubt that Dad grumbles again about having not
brought three sweaters.

At 1555 there is a terrible disaster.

Andy had decided that it was better for the diesel engine to live on a
mobile narrowboat where it could be looked at by prospective buyers, than
stationary in Maldon with Teal.  Therefore we have the wretched engine
sitting on the foredeck, completely in the way.  (No one has come to see
it yet)  It is covered in a bright blue tarpaulin, (to help it blend in
with the soft greens, reds and rusts of Coki's paintwork I don't think)
to keep the rain off, but Julian always forgets that under the nice soft
looking tarpaulin, lurks a big, nasty, sharp, spiky engine.  He is
leaping athletically onto the roof from the foredeck when he forgets this
and brings his knee painfully, accurately and extremely firmly into
contact with a bit of the engine.  I can only imagine him sitting down in
a hurry and reeling from the pain.  His knee swells up to three times
it's normal size and starts to throb.  Julian, being Julian, hobbles on.

1700  Dad is taken back to Elton lock by Julian to find his car and
departs, leaving Julian is great pain, alone on the boat.
