The Great Narrowboat Move, Part Six

</PRE><A NAME="Day8"><PRE>
DAY EIGHT CONTINUED 05/04/04 - WE FINALLY LEAVE PETERBOROUGH!

After much faffing all morning and for a lot of the useful part of the
afternoon, Dad, Julian and I final;ly set off.  The sun is shining
although there are squally showers on the horizon that threaten rain and
APrilness later.  There are birds singing and I have bought a pair of
binoculars, justifying them as a necessity for reading distant signs on
the canal, but more because I want to know what the wretched tweety
things are!  The birds are particularly elusive on the first strech of
the Nene.  There are lots of blackthorn bushes out in flower and the
hawthorn is all turning that glorious green thta heralds the coming of
Spring and Summer.  The dratted birds lurk cleverly amongst the branches,
singing prettily but staying completely out of sight.  The only birds we
manage to spot apart from the all present pigeons is an electric pylon
covered in cormorants! 

On the starboard side is some sort of sculpture park.  I hope it's free
to get in, we were not impresed (even with the binoculars!) by what we
saw.

1605 Orton Lock - Our first  It's very big and wide as there are two
weirs, and there appear to be lots of long white stick things dangling in
the water to persuade even the most stupid novice boaty that going
towards the weirs is a BAD PLAN.  We enter the lock with aplomb,
rebounding from one wall onto the other and making an ungainly scramble
up the ladder on the right hand side to tie up.

The locks on the Nene are something of a dreadful folklore from what I
can gather from other boaters.  In fact, the Nene itself appears to be a
'cursed' section of the network with very little usage.  Very very odd,
because the landscape is utterly amazing, little packhorse bridges
gracefully spanning a winding river that meanders through sleepy little
stone cottaged hamlets and gorgeous expanses of unspoilt rurality.  

And Northampton, but for the rest of the trip even I can forgive
Northampton.

The locks are mainly of the 'guillotine gate' variety.  This means from
the downstream part (from Peterborough towards Northampton, the way we're
coming from) you enter the lock underneath a vast metal gate that is
about a foot thick and suspended above your head, which drips nasty river
water on you.  You then find yourself in a spacious lock with 'Vee' doors
(the traditional lock gates you immediately think of) at the upstream end
of the lock.  The locks are made of concrete... not very pretty, and
there is a ladder up out of them on the starboard side close to the
guillotine gate, and the port side very close to the Vee gates.  We aim
for the starboard ladder (whilst trying not to get jammed accross the
lock) and I scramble ashore.  Once the boat is safely in, (or in should i
say, safely with me, Dad and Julian on board is a misnomer) you lower the
guillotine gate and wait for the levels to rise.

There are several ingenious ways of lowering the gate that the
Environment Agency, who run this river, have come up with.  The first,
and least traditional, is an electric switch system, where you press a
big green button and watch the immense bits of machinery go to work.  The
guillotine gate has a counterbalance which rises up as the guillotine
lowers and the chain in between looks like something from a giants cycle
repair kit.  Amazing stuff.  Your finger can get quite tired and I
recommend finding some interested children to do the pressing for you. 
You have to hang onto it all the time!  (Takes a few minutes) 

The second, more fun, more traditional, but sadly least common method, is
a very well balanced winch system with a big handle you whir round and
round.  Great fun, and it rolls nicely and doesn't feel like too much
hard work.

The third, most modern, safety conscious, rubbish and sadly I fear, soon
to be the most prevelent, is an enormous silver disk you are expected to
spin round and round.  It's like the disks they've put on childrens
roundabouts these days to stop you being able to get any grip and make it
go round fast at all.  The wheel is awkward, heavy, cumbersome and
totally wearing.  Yuck.  Whoever dreamt them up should be made to operate
a lock all day and then they'd see how crap they are!

This is an electric lock.  We have a fight with our EA key, ABLOY thing
that will open all of the little control panals and padlocks on the
river.  Luckily not only does it fit, but it also opens the door.  We
press the button.  The gate lowers.  
We get the adjustable spanner that Andy firmly believes is just as fast
as a lock key, and very very very painfully slowly open the lock gates. 
Luckily there are no boaties around to laugh at us, but perhaps if there
had been they could have leant us their key and we would have got through
about ten minutes faster.  Slowly the water equalise and we get ready to
open the vee gates.  Now some people come to watch us, and we discover
there is a boat behind, so once we've oened the gates, off we jolly well
go!

The time is 1620, Yardwell is still a good 11 miles away.  Perhaps an
evening drink with Emma, rther than the lunch/dinner I had suggested?

We find ourselves on a really beautiful stretch of river with bluebells
bursting into flower on the lightly wooded right hand bank, and eerily
shaped pollarded willows festooning the expansive water meadow to the
left.  Herons.  Sunlight.  I sing, a lot, not than anyone can hear me
because the generator is on and going
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

There next hour has a lot of weather in it.  Rain, hail, wind, and
sunshine, lots and lots of forgiving sunshine.  There is a fabuous
rainbow.  By now I am losing my fear of failing.  The boat is behaving,
there isn't too much wind, the scenery is delightful, there is excellent
company, and we're on our way!  No groundings, and the locks aren't
impossible.  Joy.

1750 - Alwarton Lock approaches.  We are rather distressed by the ammount
of water pouring over the Vee gates at the end of the lock.  Maybe the
paddles are open?  There is water spurting everywhere and it's making a
hell of a racket!  Manoevuring the boat into a lock with a waterfal at
the end for the first time is a rather daunting experience.  Julian is at
the helm.  I get rather stressed and make sure I am ashore as fast as
possible with the rope.  

'Slow Down!!! If we get the prow under all that pouring water then we
will SINK!'

Julian is smiling and nodding and helming, and doesn't make a hash of it
at all.  I apologise for being hysterical.
This lock is the only one I encountered with a winch handle.  Great fun,
takes a while though.  A wren carols in a nearby bush and the light from
the sinking sun makes everything glow with that warm evening softness. 
Glorious.  The water pouring over the gates means that we don't need to
open the paddles, thank goodness.  

1810!  Onwards Onwards!

Oh, no....

I have just read the Environment Agency sign above the winch for the
gate.  Apparently, probably for health and saffety, you have to 'default'
the lock, that is empty all of the water out of it and raise the
guillotine gate again.  What?!  That's going to take ages!!!!

1825 we leave, the gate once again aloft and my arms aching.  There are
mooring places on either side of the lock which we had assumed were for
unsure boaties (such as ourselves) to tie up to and work out the best
course of approach, but it would appear not.  These are so you can get
through the lock, make a hash of mooring up, get grumpy and then have to
spend ten more minutes fighting with the gates.  Humph!

NO OVERNIGHT MOORING
says the sign by the moorings, firmly.

1920 - We arrive at the idyllic hamlet of Water Newton, dominated by a
water mill with a gorgeous garden.  We blunder into the lock, having
slowed down enough this time that the inevitable bump doesn't make me
wince too much.  Another electric gate.  I fish a plastic bag out from
the prop.  (All narrowboats have a clever little insection hatch above
the propellor that you can lift up.  This is to remove weeds, bags, and
in Julian and Andy's case, a bikini, from around the propellor.  Not a
good idea to do it when you're moving as 
a) You'll probably flood the boat
b)You''l definitely chop your arm off.)

Dad and Julian exit the lock and then completely balls up trying to get
alongside on the moornings.  I leave them to it and go to default the
lock.  As I close the gates I watch them drifting helpless ly accross to
the gorgeous garden of the mill, completely out of control and pulled by
the weir and the gentle evening breeze.
As the guillotine gate rises they have managed to quant off and appear to
be going backwards towards the weir.
By the time the lock is completely reset, they are still on the opposite
bank and appear to be geting quite hot and bothered.  I hunt for firewood
in the hedge while they sort them selves out.

1950 - I reboard, having walked a bit further along the towpath.  The sun
vanishes... still many miles to go before we can stop!
