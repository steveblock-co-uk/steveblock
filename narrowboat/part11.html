The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Eleven

DAY SEVENTEEN - 12/04/04 - MAD BOATIES: BEYOND THE AQUADROME

It's a peaceful Monday morning.  I can hear birds singing, and the soft
spring morning light is making those little water wavelet patterns on the
ceiling.  I give a contented sigh and roll over on the single bed,
swathed in duvet, in the forecabin to peer into the living room and peep
at Ben and Kate who are just waking up on the futon.  I get up and put
the kettle on.  What a lovely day!  We're halfway at last and today will
be my first bit of soloing :o)

Peter awakens and peers out of the porthole.
"Where are we?"

"We're at Little Billing remember, at the morrings opposite the pub."
"Oh No We're Not."

WHAT?!

It appears that at some unknown time in the night, some berks from the
Billing Mill Pub have decided to cast Coroskeir adrift! The brigoons!  We
are now lying against the side of the channel where we came in, amongst
some plants and a half submerged shopping trolley.

"Oh dear"

No harm done.  Our mooring stake is still forlornly waiting on the bank
where we had been tied up only a few hours before.  The wretches.  No way
our three lines could have come off on their own!

We chug off towards the marina, and the pumpout station.  Everyone is
very disiplined about going to the loo so that we can use the ones on
shore.  We tie up with no mishaps, and while everyone has breakfast and
prepares to leave the boat, I go to find out about pumping out.

Oh dear.

It would appear there is no pumpout station here!  the Imray book has
failed us once again.  Looks like it'll be Northampton then, which we
should reach by the afternoon.  Or rather, I should reach by the
afternoon, if there are no disasters.  
Everyone uses the toilets on shore, and we find a coots nest tucked away
on the back of one of the other boats in the marina, with a rather
bemused looking coot on it.  Then again, all coots look a bit bemused, so
this was nothing special.
The Wynns leave with much waving and my greatest heartfelt thanks.  I
would like to repeat that, as we wouldn't have got all that way so fast
without you and your canoe antics!

I walk slowly back along the pontoons to Coroskeir.  
Just her and me now.

The sun beams down, and there is only a light breeze.  What's the worst
that can happen?
I make sure I have evrything I need in the engine room.  A drink, the
maps, the log, my camera, the binoculars...  
0905  I start the engine.  I cast off.  I give us a good shove, and
gently, smoothly, we slip away from the pontoon.

First things first.  I cross the lake and return to last nights moorings
to rerieve the lost post, having left one behind at Woodford we need all
the mooring posts we can find!  Mooring up is much easier when you can
concentrate and don't have everyone telling you how to do it.  We don't
even run aground.  I have a quick chat with the chap on the mooring next
door who spreads no light on the mysterious adriftness.  Then again, we
were bumping into his boat a bit last night, maybe it was him!  He is
feeding the geese, so I do not approve of him, as the geese are quite fat
enough already, and those nasty canada geese things that hiss all the
time and attack children.  
Anyway.  Onwards

0915  Things begin to get interesting.  I manage to manoevure under the
first little bridge on the cut and out towards the main channel.  I am
very aware of the force of the weir (on the right now, as I am coming
down the channel) which pushes us into the left hand bank.  I steer over
towards the right, not that there is much place to steer as it's all very
narrow.  
Now.  There is a little generator that sits on the roof is broken and
unuseable and Andy is trying to get rid of it.  It's a bit of a menace
when you're walking down the boat roof, as often you forget it's there
and fall over it, or it snarls up the ropes as you try and tie up.

Right now it's about halfway down the boat and busy getting itself hooked
by an overhanging branch.
Before I can blink, it's accelerating down the roof of the boat at high
speed, aiming for my head, pushed along by the branch.
Things go into slow motion.
I think 'Crikey!  I'm about to lose my head!'
Then I think 'Move the logbook!' and make a desperate grab for it before
it disappears over the side.
Finally 'It may be rubbish, but I bet Andy expects to get money for it!'
and make a desperate lunge for it as it tries to whizz past and knock me
flying.
I think the adrenalin had kicked in, because I somehow managed to hang
onto it and pull it back onboard with one hand, whilst fighting with the
branch it was attached to.

Calmness.  The boat is covered in bits of tree again.

Now I have arrived at the fork in the river.  The main channel I want to
follow is on a 'U' bend.  At the bottom of the 'U' there is a big bridge
with a couple of columns in the wrong places which we had had much fun
and games negotiating (mainly with the quant pole and three people) the
night before.  The 'U' bend is even trickier.  I spend about twenty
minutes running backwards and forwards along the edge of the boat, armed
with my trusty pole.  First I have to get her wedged accross the bridge,
a feat in itself as there are some rather shallow bits, and then
carefully quant her nose round whilst pushing her back in and fending off
the canoe and the paintwork on the columns.  I get a bit hot, but feel
proud and relieved once it's all achieved.  Then a very good omen, a
sparrowhawk alights from a branch just overhead, giving me a very good
view through the binoculars.  Wonderful.

0940  I approach BILLING LOCK.  This is the first lock I have done on my
own, and so approach with extreme caution at very low speed with
everything ready on the roof - rope, winch handle, etc.  I manage to come
alongside absolutely perfectly, which I feel extremely chuffed about.  I
scramble up the ladder, tie her up, sort out the canoe, lower the gate
and then open the paddles and enjoy the sunshine.  There are lots of dog
walkers and cyclists, none of whom look particularly interested in a
scruffy urchin with a scruffy boat working the lock on a sunny morning.

At 0952 I get a call from Julian to check everything is going alright. 
His poor knee!  He is having a great time at Wykhurst but is extremely
limited in what he can do.  The other anglo-saxons have advised him to
see a physician, and he did.  Now he is armed with most un-Anglo-saxonish
crutches, but nothing has broken, it's all just extremely bruised and
battered.  He has been advised to rest and elevate it for a week, so of
course, he's coming out to help with the boat on Tuesday evening onwards.

I move Cori out of the lock by pulling her, and moor up to reset.  Just
as I have finished another boat chugs into sight in the opposite
direction!  Drat.  It's taken 45 minutes.

The next part of the journey follows the curve of the river alongside a
terribly depressing looking caravan park.  Plastic bags foul the water
and there is lots of litter.  Dispirited looking children with hopeless
and bored expressions line the banks and either ignore me completely or
move away looking suspicious.  Not pleasant, despite the glorious
sunshine and beautiful weeping willow trees.

The next lock (CLIFFORD HILL) is right next to the caravan park, and
there are lots of spectators.  My heart beating in my ears, I manage to
make another perfect approach, and almost explode with pride when a man
on the shore says 'Looks like you've had lots of practise at that!'  I
grin and decide to say nothing thinking pride and falls and all that
jazz.  Luckily, along with the spectators are lots of willing children,
so I give them a lesson in locks and they do all the hard work.  Hee hee
hee.  To make things even better, another two boats are coming the other
way, so I don't have to default the lock!  I leave 15 minutes after my
arrival and chug on.  There 's meant to be Clifford Hill somewhere, which
looks like it might have been an old motte and bailey, but I couldn't see
it.

The river gets dramatically wider, and I am happily skimming along,
looking for the big sluices that are somewhere ahead, when I notice the
little river marker sign pointing down a tiny cut in the right hand bank.
 I follow the cut through some very pretty moorings, praying I won't meet
anything coming the opposite direction as it's really really narrow, and
there are lots of weathered looking boaties who would no doubt make
offhand remarks about bad helming.  Having not had any mishaps I arrive
at WESTON FLAVELL LOCK and go through the usual manoevures, helped by a
very friendly family who also have a narrowboat but who are only walking
today.  I collect some firewood from a pile on the bank that I assume has
been pulled out of the lock.

1150  Negotiate another horrid bridge, part of the flood defences.  Very
very narrow and there is a bit more wind now.  Not surprisingly, I bump
into it, though not hard enough to do any damage.
By noon I am on a lovely wide stretch making a break for Northampton.  I
get a call from Sarah and Kev who are making way and all sorted.  I ask
them to ring once they're at Northampton and I can arrange a place to
meet them then.
Sadly the batteries can do no more, so I swop to the generator and try
and enjoy the river wearing ear defenders.
Noted in the log:
1207  Tasty rower
1209  Moody rower
As I remember, one rower had a nice smile and the other one looked
terribly sulky that anyone else would dare use his bit of river.

At 1220 I arrived, having gone down another tiny cut, at ABINGTON LOCK. 
I was now very definitely on the outskirts of Northampton, but it was
still pretty, with a great plethora af gorgeous daffodils.  I forgot to
pick some for the boat though.  Silly me.  The lock at Abington was made
up of two sets of 'V' gates - the traditional lock gates most people
think of.  Bit worrying though, that now all the gates were padlocked to
stop them being tampered with!  Abington had to be reset before I could
get Cori in, which I started to do, but once the lock was empty I still
couldn't open the gates!
I puffed and panted for several minutes before realising they really were
not going to move.  Little need for padlocks here!  Luckily this area of
the river seems very popular for dog walkers and I pounced on one couple
to help me.  The chap made 'poor weak girl' noises, and then went
extremely pink trying to help me move them which made me feel a bit
better.
"Don't envy you that" he said as they strolled off.

I moved Coroskeir into the lock and tried to close the gates.  No chance.
 Luckily a couple with a very cute labrador puppy were on hand, and then
waited about for the lock to fill before helping me open the other gates
to leave.  Onward into Northampton and the pumpout station!

1320  I pass 'The Britannia' pub below RUSHED MILLS LOCK.  There are lots
of people sitting outside looking fat and bored.  I try not to look too
smug, but feel rather pleased that here I am, steering a beautiful great
58ft boat on my own.  The canoe is trailing behind.
"You've forgotten your husband love," shouts one fat balding man. "Was he
in the canoe when you left?"
"You go girrrrl!" shrieks a table of harpies.

I smile benignly and manage to get by with no mishaps.  Another boat have
just come through the lock and are faffing about on the mooring.  
They've only opened one gate, which I feel is a little too challenging,
so I wait for them to get out of the way and then tie up on the moorings
to open the other one.  It is a lot greyer now and begins to spit with
rain.

1405  Go underneath the immense A428 road bridge.  The sky is now very
grey and miserable, it's almost like a portent to the Northampton
approach.  I can hear cars all the time, even over the sound of the
generator.   Northampton looms on the starboard bank.  Ruined and disused
factories menace us from the sides of the river.  The litter level has
quadrupled.  It's grey and horrid and I almost wish that I could turn
back and run to the narrow meanders of the Nene.  At least it was green
there!

1425  Having just been scowled at by some fishermen, I give a triumphant
shout - The Pumpout Station, The Pumpout Station!
A rather unpreposessing brick hut is on the starboard bank with it's own
jetty and a huge pumpout station sign.  I heave a sigh of relief and moor
up.  The jetty is terribly shonky and wobbles a lot.  Armed with my keys
I run up the bank to the hut and fight with the padlock.
Lifting the metal grille I peer inside.  There is the hose all coiled up.
 There is a metal drain grill in the floor.  There is a rather shaky
handed and worrying note in chalk under the 'Start' button - 'This pump
is silent'.

I sieze the end of the hose.
There's something wrong.....
The way the pumpout works is that there is a stopcock valve that you open
to allow the pump to work.  
There is no stopcock valve handle, just a little nub where the handle
used to be.  You can't turn the wretched thing on!
Bugger.

I run to the boat and get an adjustable spanner and a pair of pliers. 
This has got to work!!!

After about fifteen minutes of faffing, I give up in angry frustration. 
I lock everything up and give the brick hut a kick.  Drat drat drat drat
drat.  Our only pumpout station for miles and miles and it's bloody
broken!  Wearily I untie Cori and we continue alongside Midsummer Park. 
A very pretty name for a very uninspiring municipal park full of litter
and special brew cans.
Northampton Lock totally fails to inspire me.  Firstly there's no where
to moor up, so I resort to some park railings in desperation.  Then the
lock gates stick, so I have to get more help to move them.  Cross, tired
and feeling very bad about the pumpout station I continue.  Now looking
at the map it isn't clear if there's another pumpout station ahead.  I
carry on feeling slightly hopeful, but slightly cowed by the dominating
built up skyline of Northampton.  I go past some pretty flats and
underneath a big bridge which brings me nose to nose with the enormous
Carlsberg brewery.  No pumpout station, but a little river sign down a
cut to left which I follow.

Oh Bugger, right turn, wrong timing!  I have just entered the Grand Union
Canal and am confronted by lock 17 - the first one on the system!  Damn.

I try and reverse down the cut.  I run aground.  I go forwards a bit.  I
reverse.  I run aground.
This goes on for a bit.
Finally, having run aground a lot more and seen a very lovely swans nest,
I am lengthways across the river and trying to execute a three point
turn.
My phone rings.
The generator is roaring and there is lots of water gashing over the
rudder as I try and turn back towards Northampton.  It's Kev.  I try and
shout over the noise and hope I will be able to hear his replies.
"Hello!  How are you getting on?"
"Er.... bit busy right now.  Are you nearly here?"
"Twenty minutes away"
"Well I'll be on the waterfront.  The boat is scruffy and long with a
canoe tied to it.  She's green with rusty red panals surrounded by rather
wobbly painted faded yellow borders.  The decking is yellow, but is
covered in mud and leaves and bits of tree and so looks brown instead. 
She's got lovely brightly coloured blinds in the windows, covered in
cobwebs, and two chimneys on the roof.  The most distinguising feature is
a huge diesel engine swathed in blue tarpaulin on the foredeck.  There's
no name on her, but there is a faded celtic know design on the prow."
"Errrrr...We'll meet you in town!"
"Good idea"

I return to the waterfront and moor up to an ornamental bollard or two,
having to pull the boat forwards from my first chosen point due to a
large number of shopping trolleys and a mattress under the surface of the
water.  No, I can quite honestly say I do not like Northampton one bit.

I ask a small child living in one of the domineering overlooking flats to
mind my boat while I'm away.  He's sitting on the balcony throwing things
at people walking underneath.

Off into Northampton having padlocked the canoe to the boat and removed
everything that could be nicked from the roof.  Northampton is a complete
dump.  It's grey and horrid and the people look at you funny and skulk
off.  Everything is shut, though I do see a sign on the local theatre
that lets me know Bill Bailey and Dylan Moran are both touring at the
moment, which cheers me up a bit.  Eventually I end up at the most
enormous Morrisons you've ever seen and call Kev and Sarah to meet me
there.  I have been wandering about trying to find internet access, but
they don't appear to have internet cafes in Northampton due to the risk
of burglary.  Great.

About 5pm Sarah and Kev arrive in the forecourt of Morrisons.  it's such
a relief to see them!  I've really enjoyed soloing, but I'm really tired
and glad of the company, and Northampton is a bit scary and not a place
to be on your own.  They are both knackered, having driven all day, Kevin
all the way from Keswick, Sarah joining him at York.  Urgh.  We drive
round for about fifteen minutes trying to find somewhere not too
dangerous looking to leave the car (involving a
near-fatal-but-not-quite-almost turning down a oneway A road), finally
deciding on a Netto carpark, and then thoroughly laden with bags, food
and guitars (and some really yummy smelling wild garlic) head to the
boat.
I feel immensely proud of being able to show them round, but I don't
waste too much time doing that, plenty of time for it later when it's
dark.  I cast off, and first we have to execute another 180 degree turn
to get ourselves facing towards the Grand Union again.  

1755 Off we go!  We shout our thanks and wave goodbye to the small
bemused child on the balcony.

Next stop, lock 17!
