The great Narrowboat move


Just to keep you posted of our progress.  Reports will be irregular,
often short, and probably very uninformative ;o)

BOAT EPIC DAY ONE - 26/03/04

Right.  Having arrived at some place in Andy's rickety and slightly
unreliable heap of a new car (1970's landy, classic) last night, we awoke
at 7.30 at Streatham dry dock, somewhere in the vicinity of Ely, not
completely alert but definitely alive and enthusiastic!  By 8am we were
armed with angle grinders, scrapers, goggles and ear defenders, as well
as clothes we were happy to ruin, and the great hull scraping began.

It took a long time to get one side of the hull finished.  So long in
fact that we have the port side to scrape and paint tomorrow.  First you
get a scraper, (a bit of an old disposable saw that had been angle ground
slightly sharper than blunt) and you scrape off lots of weed and rust, as
much as you can get at.  There are lots of lovely big rust blisters that
come away really easily and are terribly satisfying to scrape.  I am
happily doing this while Andy is enveloped in a cloud of rust dust, angle
grinding the starboard side having scraped it rather quickly yesterday.

After a while we swop.  I angle grind merrily, swathed in a balaclava, my
oldest, most disrespectable trousers, my much put upon smock, safety
glasses (scratched) and ear defenders.  The sun shines, the birds sing,
the dust goes everywhere.
We break at 11am and survey our work.  Andy doesn't look too impressed, 3
hours and we have only got about 2 thirds of the way down one side, and
we haven't even started wire brushing or sanding.  My hands are
vibrating, even though the angle grinder is outside and turned off.

We continue.

About 2pm two men from the boat yard turn up.  One of them only has one
arm and a glass eye.  There really are still pirates!  They talk for a
while while we itch to get on.  One of them (the pirate, always have an
affinity with animals) tells me how to tell a kingfishers call. 
Excellent.

More vibration.  More dust.  Black snot.  Andy decides to make us dust
masks out of an old t-shirt (sometimes it is almost preferable to breathe
in dust....)  My glasses steam up.  I decide I value my eyes more than my
lungs (There are sparks flying in all directions as we both angle grind
against the clock).  By three o'clock Andy is pestering me to go faster. 
I am trying not to miss any bits of the tenacious greenish paint that
still clings just above the weld line.  Sod it, we need to start
painting!  

The paint is thick, black and noxious.  It looks like tar.  It spreads
like treacle and is tredmendously hard work.  About a thrid of the way
through....
Andy "Is it me or is this paint getting more sticky?"
Panic ensues as we try and finish the starboard side before the paint
goes off.  There are bristles off the paintbrushes everywhere, we are too
worried about the paint setting to try and remove them.

By the end we realise that it is only our tired arms and overactive
imaginations making the paint more sticky.  We have one side painted! 
Hurrah!  Tomorrow will bring more angle grinding.  Andy looks like he is
a native of some equatorial land due to the ammount of dust covering his
face.  It is impossible to take him seriously.  I must look the same,
panda eyes and black rings around nose and mouth.  Lovely.

Andy has a wash and realises without any great distress that he is doomed
to look like a great unwashed for a while, as the dust appears rather
stubborn.  Nevermind!  We shall go to Cambridge and shower at the boat
houses!

Off we go to the car.  Now, I told you it was a bit rickety, well it also
has a large crane like winch sticking out of the back.  And there's a
roof and a spare tire in the back.  All this means it is impossible to
put things in the boot, but that anyone could break in at any time.  Andy
hasn't bothered to lock it.  Oh yes, and attached to the winch is a
diesel engine waiting to go into the landy and replace the nasty,
inefficient petrol one.  One day.  Not today.  Last night when I arrived
we had to hook it back onto the landy, Andy having left it at the side of
the lane in the dark for the ducks to trip over.

Anyway all this aside, we attempt to start it.  Nothing happens.  We try
again.  Nothing.

We return to the boat (a five minute walk through a padlocked gate) and
return heaving another battery Andy has got on the boat.  When the car
didn't start the other morning at Peter's, Peter kindly leant Andy his
jump leads.  These fails to persuade the battery to work even when
connected to the new battery.
We walk back and get some tools, having tried to push start the landy out
of a rut, which proved, despite determination, impossible.
Andy now takes the useless battery out of the car and replaces it with
the new and very heavy one from the boat.  Success.  the car starts.  Now
it is a race against time to get to Halfords to buy a new car battery
before 7pm.  We had tried to leave about 5.30.  It is now 6.30.  Pedal to
the floor, gears crunching, we career off into the night, bound for
Cambridge.

.........

It is now 9pm.  We have a new battery and the car starts.  We are still
covered in black dust.  We haven't had any tea, although we did have some
chips about an hour ago.  There is a fifteen minute walk, a half an hour
drive, and a dinner to cook between now and bedtime.  But still, got to
have the pain to make the pleasure more enjoyable!

Will keep you updated as to how the epic goes.  We have dust masks now,
and rollers, so tomorrow shouldn't be quite so snotty.
