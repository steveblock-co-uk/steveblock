The Great Narrowboat Move - Part Seven

</PRE><A NAME="Day10"><PRE>
DAY TEN CONTINUED (AGAIN) - 05/04/04 - Still trying to get away from
Peterborough.

We leave Water Newton, all aboard, and the sun sinks lower and lower
before vanishing behind a hawthorn bush.  There is still a lovely glow to
the sky, and directly behind us the moon begins to rise, huge and full
and red and magical.  As it's directly behind there is a path of gold
leading out to the footplate I am standing on.  The birds are all
carolling their goodnights, and the breeze is moving the grasses softly
too and fro on the river fringes.  I am singing 'Moon River' to myself
and almost overcome with a great sense of peace and joy and rightness. 
Everything is wonderful, apart from the fact we are still a rather long
way from Yardwell, and darkness is fast approaching, but it's so very
still and lovely that that is ceasing to bother me.

There is a bend to the left.  Almost instinctively I steer the boat
round, looking backwards over my shoulder at the moon and smiling
dreamily in the half light.  I turn to look where we're going.

Now the problem with the Nene is it's really bendy.  
And the problem with the bendy bits is that they're nearly always next to
big trees.
Ahead there is a bend to the right.
On the bend is a big tree.

I push the helm hard over with a startled squeak, all thoughts of the
moon dispelled.
Gently, magestically, 
(hopelessly), Coroskier skews sideways through the tree, which turns out
to be a poor, innocent, unsuspecting willow.
There is a lot of nasty scratching noises and a cacophany of snapping
branches.  A pounding of feet.  Dad leaps onto the foredeck and gets a
large amount of willow in the face.  Julian runs to the hatch which I am
crouching down in.
"Is everything alright?!"
I peer above the edge off the roof and nearly get my head taken off by a
whippy branch which gets stuck around the tiller and has to be forcibly
removed.  Extracting willow twigs from my hair I explain that the bend
was a little sharper than I'd realised, and would it be alright if they
helped me quant off please?

On we go, me paying slightly more attention to the river, but only
because the moon is now out of sight beyond the hedge.

2100  It is reported to me that we have run out of gas halfway through
cooking dinner.  No worries, we have another cylinder.  No more tight
bends, or if there were, there weren't any nasty trees on them.  It is
now rather too dark to see with certainty where the bank is, despite the
full moon.  I am steering by watching the gap in the tree canopy, and
occaisinally getting scowled at by people in boats moored up along the
side of the Nene.

2105  It is reported to me that in trying to swop over to the other gas
bottle, Julian has inadvertantly snapped the top off the black plastic
seal, a unbeknownst to him it had a left hand thread and he had turned it
very firmly the wrong way with an adjustable spanner.  Doh.  It is now
stuck in the cylinder and we can't swop bottles till it's gone.

2110  More reports of Julian struggling manfully with the pliers and the
seal stump.  Andy has taken the decent pair to Teal.

2120  Success!  Julian fights the seal out of the cylinder and dinner
continues.  We spot an Esso station on the right hand bank - very good as
we're going to run out of diesel very soon.  Dad comes up to steer with
me and we end up arguing about the stars.  Dad, when I was a littler
child than I am now, used to spend many a night with me in his arms
telling me about the constellations.  Here was Scorpios tail and there
was a big motorcar and that was this planet.... I dicovered later on at
University that this had all been copswallop and had been rather
disillusioned.  As the stars come out we have an almighty row about
Venus, and then another slightly more silly one about Jupiter and whether
it is in fact Saturn.  Niether of us budge, then he starts critiscing my
helming.  I send him below to help with dinner.

At some point I manage to bump a bridge in 'Wansford-in-England' due to
arguing, but nothing breaks.

2145  An almighty roaring can be heard.  In the moonlight we see the next
lock (Wansford) with a great silver cascade of water heaving over the vee
gates towards us.  Novices we may be but foolhardy we are not.  At least,
we are not THAT foolhardy as to try and go through an over powered lock
in the dark with a raging torrent on the other side.  We moor up against
the bank and settle down to a very tasty tea and several bottles of wine.
 Both Julian and me are close to collapse, but Dad manages to find the
energy to stagger off to the 'Angel' in Yardwell accross the fields at
about 2230!

2330  Dad returns from his jaunt empty bellied, as the Angel was
unfortunately deserted.  Sleep.

11.7 miles achieved, and 3 locks completed.

DAY ELEVEN - 06/04/04 - Yardwell to Elton and another EA Rescue.

I wake early and ring Emma to ask if, having failed to reach  her in time
for lunch, high tea, dinner, supper, evening drinks or even a nightcap,
whether she would like to come for breakfast.  As she only lives 5
minutes away she is soon at the boat.  We set off into Wansford lock,
which isn't half so scarey and noisy in the daylight.  The batteries are
completely flat, possibly due to the new clunky switch installed by
Julian and Andy which controls whether you are on batteries or generator.
 We decide to go back to the original system of swopping the wires from
one bolt to another, even though this involves a large spark due to
static build up (or something,  not sure of the technicalities) and
slightly more fiddling.  The new system appears to be completely welded
together.

Wansford Lock takes us 45 minutes.  I am extrmely grumpy by the end of it
as 45 minutes is, even for us, totally rubbish.

At 10am we see Emmas house from the boat and take appropriate
photographs.

At 1025 we enter Yardwell Lock.  There are some EA contractors doing some
footpath work who have the coolest hand held circular saw I have ever
seen!  I watch with admiration as it chews it's way through concrete with
ease.  If only it had a metal grinding attachment, dry dock would have
taken half the time!  Unfortunately, Yardwell Lock is one of those stupid
spinny silver wheels.  It takes FOREVER! I am exhausted by the time the
gate is down, and being watched with amusement by the EA people.
We leave the lock at 1045 and tie up on the moorings beyond.  Everyone
leaves except me, Julian and Dad to do diesel, Emma to feed her cats.  I
go and sort out the spinny wheel to default the lock, quite a lot slower
than when I opened the lock the first time... then, very hot and weary, I
start the generator and stand in the engine room with the ear protectors
on, looking at the whole charging system with an expression of distrust
and total bafflement.  After about two minutes of failing to have any
bright ideas about why the whole thing isn't working, I switch off the
generator again and swop the batteries onto solar panel charging. 
Unfortunately it is overcast so this does very very little.

Another boat comes into the lock.  Their paintwork is very shiny and they
are obviously on holiday.  They give Coroskier a rather pitying look.  I
give them one back seeing as they don't have a canoe, and if, horror of
horror, they should hit something, they'd look really daft with a big
scrape.  Cori now has so many that she just looks weathered.  I wish we
hadn't only painted her a week ago!

I then realise that I am in the way on the moorings and so feel obliged
to offer to 'default' the lock again.  They very readily agree, seeing as
it's that stupid spinny silver wheel, and it took all three of them twice
as long as it took me to close the gate!  After they leave, casting
another glance as my beautiful boat, I secretly hope that their toilet
breaks, and set my shoulder to the wheel a third time.

When Julian, Emma and Dad finally return I'm exhausted.  J&D go off to
put cars in the right places for various escapades, having ended up
taking Emma with them to the petrol station, as they had absolutely no
idea where it was.  Emma and i untie and continue, quickly, before I have
to 'default' the lock for anyone else!  Julian sets the battery/generator
swopping system up so it works, and Emma and I head off alone towards the
village of Elton.

We see a sparrowhawk very exciting with binoculars) and Emma steers like
a trooper, being used to tiller boats as she is a dinghy racer.  I am
very impressed, but helm in the rainy patches swathed in my new
waterproof trousers and Andy's battered waterproof jacket.  We don't hit
anything and see some really gorgeous bridges, despite the weather. 
There is a very cold wind.

1325  We reach Elton lock and manage quite a classy, non contact
manoevure into the lock, watched with admiration by some Envirnment
Agency people who are mowing the grass around the lock and it's weir.  We
scramble onto the bank and start to open the paddles, having lowered the
gate, with the adjustable spanner.

1330  An EA chappie comes over waving his hands and offers us their lock
key.
"It'll take you hours with that" he says, giving the adjustable a dirty
look.
Yes, it does take hours by comparison.  Armed with the lock key, we
hurtle the paddles up in no time, and thanking EA chappie,  prepare to
continue.

1345  "'Ere, don't you 'ave one of these?" asks EA chappie with concern.
"No, the chap we're borrowing the boat off thinks an adjustable spanner
is fine."
The EA chappie raises his eyebrows and goes off to talk to his companion.
We start to exit the lock, Emma at the very front of the boat, me
steering.  As we leave the EA people come up and offer me the lock key. 
"Take it, we don't need it!" they say kindly.  I thank them profusely,
wishing them every blessing.  Emma is saying something at the front, but
I am too bus thanking the EA people to hear.  Plus the generator is going
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR so it's impossible to hear
anything other than a bellow in your earhole anyway.

1346  A big gust of wind.

This, combined with the fact that there is a weir to the left and a very
sharp corner to the right and our engine being the size of a bantam,
means we end up stuck in the bank, completely incapable of turning right
up the river, and rather embarressingly stuck.  Again.

I try and reverse and the quant off, but the wind is suddenly too strong
and I'm a bit rubbish at such things anyway.

The EA people are watching, similar to the ones on the first day, with
expressions of mild amusement.
We thrown them a rope evenually, although I muff the throw once as well,
adn they pull us around the corner to the moorings, and the head off in
their little white van, which all angels must drive.
