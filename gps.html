    <H2>GPS Troubles</H2>
    
    <P>
      I used my GPS for the first time in the White Mountains back in February.
      My AMC map said
      'Projection based on NH state plane NGS datum 1983'
      so I set my GPS to use the NAD83 datum.
      The problem was that the UTM co-ordinates displayed on my GPS didn't agree with those on the map.
      The GPS co-ordinates appeared to be about 250m north of the true location, or about 5mm on my 1:47500
      scale Presidential Range map.
    </P>
    <P>
      Recently, I finally got round to addressing the problem and spent many hours doing research
      into map datums and co-ordinate frames.
      I still couldn't explain the discrepancy, so posted a question to the Google group
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=rec.backcountry">rec.backcountry</A>.
      Here is the 
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&threadm=3bdedcda.0405291112.107b1740%40posting.google.com&rnum=1&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dutm%2Bamc%2Bgroup:rec.backcountry%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26group%3Drec.backcountry%26selm%3D3bdedcda.0405291112.107b1740%2540posting.google.com%26rnum%3D1">entire thread</A>.
      I also forwarded my original post to
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=sci.geo.satellite-nav">sci.geo.satellite-nav</A>
      and
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=sci.geo.cartography">sci.geo.cartography</A>,
      resulting in
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&th=379eefef387ce358">this thread</A>.
      Finally I posted
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=utm+amc+group:alt.satellite.gps.*&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=alt.satellite.gps.*&selm=3bdedcda.0405301212.3bbc0144%40posting.google.com&rnum=1">this question</A>
      to
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=alt.satellite.gps">alt.satellite.gps</A>,
      but failed to get any replies.
    </P>
    <P>
      No-one provided me with a solution, which I thought was surprising as this is one of the 
      most popular series of maps for the White Mountains!
      However, several of the replies did point me in the right direction and I eventually figured it out
      for myself.
      I posted my
      <A TARGET="GPS" HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=utm+amc&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=3bdedcda.0406011930.5008f07c%40posting.google.com&rnum=3">conclusions</A>
      to all four groups and they're summarised below.
    </P>

    <LI> The map datum is NAD27 CONUS (NGS survey 1927 for CONtinental United States)
    <LI> The UTM co-ordiantes on the map are correct
    <LI> The NH state plane co-ordinate system on which the map projection is based is that which uses the NAD83 datum
         (But the map itself does NOT use the NAD83 datum!)
