                           "    While not required for non-owered vessels, the registration process provided us with a Massachusetts hull number, which helped enourmously with our looking legit." +
                           "    The registration process involved an inspection, where we had to demonstrate that the boat was indeed non-powered and that we weren't a danger to other water users." +
                           "    The State Trooper conducting the inspection was clearly impressed, and other than a warning for an expired trailer registration, we passed with flying colours." +

      <h2> The Return of The Bel Air </h2>

      <p> After the intense dissappointment of being
          <a href="belAir.html">turned away at the dock</a>
          in 2005, Scott and I were determined to watch the 4th July fireworks from the Bel Air in 2006.

      <p> Our plans called for a series of improvments, some to improve the function of the car, others to improve its appearance in an effort to avoid a repeat of the previous year.
